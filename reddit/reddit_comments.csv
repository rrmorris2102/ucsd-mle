t1_gsn7xq2,"assess the dip, look at it really closely like a scientist does a specimen or the stool of a subject, then realize that it only dips because people are trying to exit as fast as possible. Out of everyone I know only... 5? of them have bitcoin. One of them has just over 2, and she isn't selling. Of course, she bought hers back when it was under 20,000 I think, so she is very much without anything to lose. The thing is, the more that people buy BTC and just take it off of the exchange completely, the more it will be worth. If you bought in near the peak or something, then absolutely sell or make a stop loss. Don't fool yourself into thinking BTC stays bullish forever, because it most likely won't. After you do what you gotta do for your exit strategy, look at the chart for the past 2 months. Identify the very bottom of every dip that has happened, where the price fell from, and how much these dips differ. You will be able to find a far better entry point like this, but it could still tank. Rather than worry about this treat it like a retirement fund, and if you see a major dip then put a little more money in. I am certain it will go lower, but I doubt it will cross 50000.

Since when does an US company sends info to the UK taxman ?
Only if the UK taxman makes a request on a specific person to Coinbase.

Just one thing: keep the amounts per wire transfer below ¬£6500,- I'm not sure about the exact amount currently, but in the past it was 7500‚Ç¨ (6455¬£).
Large amounts are detected by software. So don't send ¬£20,000 in one go.",t2_6xizsreq,2021-03-28 19:23:46+00:00

What wallet are you using and are you setting the transfer manually? If so you can check the current gas prices at https://ethgasstation.info/index.php to avoid overpaying (by apparently almost 20x... in your case!). Hope that helps a bit. 

Completely agree that gas prices are annoyingly high at the moment, they definitely add up when you're setting up complex DeFi transactions, but there's no need to spend that sort of gas just moving stuff around.",t2_imdxj,2021-03-28 16:52:43+00:00

t1_gsm0hrw,"&gt; I did not move anything at those prices. 

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token? What am I missing?",t2_imdxj,2021-03-28 19:41:07+00:00
