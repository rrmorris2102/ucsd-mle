I've good connections with the mainstream (The Daily Telegraph, The New-York Times etc.) and crypto media to push this project and secure an awareness about him + social media (SMM, SEO). As a professional Finance consultant and professor of Corporate Finance I've developed a business-model to secure that the project will break even.

I think the project needs a developer to create maybe on the already existing code the basic digital wallet. The new will be the voice identification of the user, the voice management of the digital wallet and the service of voice advertising. Possible investors and supporters of this socially important project are welcome, you can send me a direct message. Initially I've come to the idea of this project since one of the most important people in my life, my teacher, is blind.",bitcoin,

t3_mevewy,"So i started crypto trading in feb when the dogecoin was getting hype so i said why the fu*k not so i took about 150$ from my savings ( i m 18 year old student and saved some money by giving tuitions to kids,, also thats quiet a amount in a third world country) and put 100$ @ 5.5 all into dogecoin it went up a little and i became happy with a 5% gain but decided to hold and after a day
 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1359519541219500033?s=19

 this tweet came out from elon about him buying doge for his son.. 

I panik buyed @7 like a stupid retard and buyed at pick price and just sat there thinking myself as a winner..but then everyone start selling and price went down to 5..now i thought that the hype is dead and just like what happened when elon first talked about doge and it pumped to 8.5 and fall to 3..i thought it will again fall to near 3 so i sold at loss    (buy high sell low lol) @5 and successfully turned my 150$ to 123$.. 


** never buy a coin while its pumping or just because someone is talking about it...this thing is called shilling where a person buy a coin at low price and then start to talk about it and promote the coin so prices go up and then they earn from your stupidity**


now i thought to myself i would never buy at peak so i looked around to find a coin which is at low price so i found CREAM.. at that time it was around 250$ and its all time high was 380$ so i thought 'yeah why not,its a discount right'..and invested all my money into it...but it kept falling and falling..i thought that i will not repeat what i did in doge and just hold but the price dropped to 180$ so me getting more and more upset i just sold it..now i dropped from 123$ to 88$..


**never buy a coin just because its low..and never buy a coin you dont know anything about..maybe you have heard this thing many times now but please do your own research..

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

t3_mfex7b,"For anyone buying BTC right now (price at 51130), I doubt BTC will even touch 55500 again before midnight(EST, so 2 1/2 hours). Not to worry though, it'll breakthrough and be supported at 56000, 60000, and definitely higher in the near future, but I see a lot of people thinking they're going to cause a bull rush by buying 0.005 BTC at the ask price. It does have an effect, but only in the sense it makes sellers set bolder limits. Then we're down again. It's like being at an amusements park. The fun part is on the way down. Be patient, and set bids instead of market orders. I think 54100 might be a good limit, but it's hard to tell. the past week I watched this happen about 5 times with BTC. A thousand mark gets crossed, it bounces momentarily, then it maybe happens one more time before the next time it gets crossed and shit hits the fan. There's just so many FOMO bag hodlers from the recent peak. They can only stand to see it cross certain lines. After failing to reach the peak two weeks later I expect we will see massive selling this week. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't really know anything.",btc,

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token?

Most people don't put their whole portfolio's in these but sometimes a meme coin can generate a year worth of hype in a single day which makes a lot of millionaires quickly but that's not the essence of this. The main goal or rather the reason people believe these ""shitcoins"" is they fell inlove with the community and want to see it succeed along with their investment. I certainly do.",doge,

t3_mevewy,"So i started crypto trading in feb when the dogecoin was getting hype so i said why the fu*k not so i took about 150$ from my savings ( i m 18 year old student and saved some money by giving tuitions to kids,, also thats quiet a amount in a third world country) and put 100$ @ 5.5 all into dogecoin it went up a little and i became happy with a 5% gain but decided to hold and after a day

 this tweet came out from elon about him buying doge for his son.. 

I panik buyed @7 like a stupid retard and buyed at pick price and just sat there thinking myself as a winner..but then everyone start selling and price went down to 5..now i thought that the hype is dead and just like what happened when elon first talked about doge and it pumped to 8.5 and fall to 3..i thought it will again fall to near 3 so i sold at loss    (buy high sell low lol) @5 and successfully turned my 150$ to 123$.. 


** never buy a coin while its pumping or just because someone is talking about it...this thing is called shilling where a person buy a coin at low price and then start to talk about it and promote the coin so prices go up and then they earn from your stupidity**


now i thought to myself i would never buy at peak so i looked around to find a coin which is at low price so i found CREAM.. at that time it was around 250$ and its all time high was 380$ so i thought 'yeah why not,its a discount right'..and invested all my money into it...but it kept falling and falling..i thought that i will not repeat what i did in doge and just hold but the price dropped to 180$ so me getting more and more upset i just sold it..now i dropped from 123$ to 88$..


**never buy a coin just because its low..and never buy a coin you dont know anything about..maybe you have heard this thing many times now but please do your own research..

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

As for me i will still try hard as i can to turn my 90$ to 250$ so i dont get scolded by my parents..",chz,

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),long,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t1_gsnnqi9,"If you are friends with someone that knows the modern art scene, you can grab some pieces that could easily skyrocket over time...but you will want to research who those big names are outside of Beeple. 

You are looking at a revolution of fine artists going digital and not needing to somehow score a gallery in NYC to get noticed. It really is the democratization of art. This industry has been overrun by pretentious rich snobs for far too long and the reach for unknown budding artists is super exciting. 

So with all that, why do I think some will skyrocket? Since crypto is just starting to gain some mainstream momentum, there’s still many crypto millionaires waiting to be made and they will probably have spare money to spend. If they decide to start collecting, there will be art that was released during this bull run that will never be available again aside from secondary market sales. So that $500, $750, $1000 piece you paid for may be worth 10s of thousands because it can’t be replicated again. 

I know, it’s all weird as hell...there’s a ton of unfounded trust in the system and there will be scams and copyright problems that will come up...

...oh, and there is definitely a bubble forming

But if you pick the right pieces by the right artists and don’t have paper hands and wait out the inevitable bubble pop, I think there definitely is money to be made. 

DYOR and good luck to you!",long,

t1_gsn7xq2,"assess the dip, look at it really closely like a scientist does a specimen or the stool of a subject, then realize that it only dips because people are trying to exit as fast as possible. Out of everyone I know only... 5? of them have bitcoin. One of them has just over 2, and she isn't selling. Of course, she bought hers back when it was under 20,000 I think, so she is very much without anything to lose. The thing is, the more that people buy BTC and just take it off of the exchange completely, the more it will be worth. If you bought in near the peak or something, then absolutely sell or make a stop loss. Don't fool yourself into thinking BTC stays bullish forever, because it most likely won't. After you do what you gotta do for your exit strategy, look at the chart for the past 2 months. Identify the very bottom of every dip that has happened, where the price fell from, and how much these dips differ. You will be able to find a far better entry point like this, but it could still tank. Rather than worry about this treat it like a retirement fund, and if you see a major dip then put a little more money in. I am certain it will go lower, but I doubt it will cross 50000.

It does have an effect, but only in the sense it makes sellers set bolder limits. Then we're down again. It's like being at an amusements park. The fun part is on the way down. Be patient, and set bids instead of market orders. I think 54100 might be a good limit, but it's hard to tell. the past week I watched this happen about 5 times with BTC. A thousand mark gets crossed, it bounces momentarily, then it maybe happens one more time before the next time it gets crossed and shit hits the fan. There's just so many FOMO bag hodlers from the recent peak. They can only stand to see it cross certain lines.

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),one,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine.

Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out.

We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

Last week's pick (well, a few days ago anyway):

SC @ 0.016
Current price: 0.02256
41% increase, certified genius.

Overall market trend for the week: Hold/Buy

Entry picks:

BAT - recent climbs to continue after consolidating and finding support in 0.8-0.85 range aiming to retest 1.00 within next few weeks. 

KSM - Risen meteorically in the last month from 175.00 to 410.00, barely even stopping to consolidate on the way, I expect this to continue.

NANO - I bought this at an awful time and eagerly anticipate a rise so i can break even and dump my bag. Seems to have finally found a floor at 3.6, hopefully can find some resurgence and tackle 5.00 again soon.

UNI - Recently consolidated and found support at 22.80, should break past 25.00 again and start retesting 30.00. Feels very underbought.

PRICE PREDICTIONS:
BAT - 1.02
KSM - 460.00
NANO - 4.50
UNI - 27.5

Exit picks:

Don't sell anything.

t1_gsm0hrw,"&gt; I did not move anything at those prices. 

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token? What am I missing?",ada,

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),link,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token?

It does have an effect, but only in the sense it makes sellers set bolder limits. Then we're down again. It's like being at an amusements park. The fun part is on the way down.

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),bull,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t1_gsnnqi9,"If you are friends with someone that knows the modern art scene, you can grab some pieces that could easily skyrocket over time...but you will want to research who those big names are outside of Beeple. 

You are looking at a revolution of fine artists going digital and not needing to somehow score a gallery in NYC to get noticed. It really is the democratization of art. This industry has been overrun by pretentious rich snobs for far too long and the reach for unknown budding artists is super exciting. 

So with all that, why do I think some will skyrocket? Since crypto is just starting to gain some mainstream momentum, there’s still many crypto millionaires waiting to be made and they will probably have spare money to spend. If they decide to start collecting, there will be art that was released during this bull run that will never be available again aside from secondary market sales. So that $500, $750, $1000 piece you paid for may be worth 10s of thousands because it can’t be replicated again. 

I know, it’s all weird as hell...there’s a ton of unfounded trust in the system and there will be scams and copyright problems that will come up...

...oh, and there is definitely a bubble forming

But if you pick the right pieces by the right artists and don’t have paper hands and wait out the inevitable bubble pop, I think there definitely is money to be made.

There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t3_mexne3,Info regarding moons and how to earn them.,moon,
t3_mexne3,"Since we are many new people here i thought this would be good for the new people to know regarding moons. 

Basically you earn moons from Karma once a month but there is a few things that determine how much you will earn.

Edit: Forgot the most important part! If you are on the reddit app go to your profile and activate the Moon vault! 

Iirc you can only do it on the app and you have 6 months to claim your moons in the vault.

Post Karma - Each upvote/downvote has 1 karma, unless it is a meme or media, then it is 10%.


Comment Karma - Each comment upvote/downvote gets 2 karma since the there was a proposal to make comments give 2x karma that passed.


Karma limit - limit of 1000 karma per post or comment.

When do you get the moons? - Moons are distributed every 4 weeks 

What is the current ratio? - The ratio normaly get lower each month for an example last one was 0.42 which means 1 Karma equals to 0.42 moons, the one before that was 0.52 and the one before that was 0.87.


Proposal regarding moons that got accepted.


20% bonus : If you don't move out your moons, you get +20% on next 
distribution.


5% voting bonus : This one is passed but not official yet. If you vote on proposals, you'll get +5% on next distribution.

Posts with the comedy flair only get 10% of the Karma earned from that post.

You can also look up moons on Coingecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon ) 

To see how much they are worth and where they are listed, and the total supply of moons that will be released (out of 250m around 60m is 'released')

Edit: The ratio is dynamic and don't necessary have to get lower but considering it went lower the last 5-6  month i assume it will continue get lower.

Edit 2: Apperently a few cant see/activate their vault and some nice fella posted this 

'Should also note; you'll have to get the official reddit app (gross) and then also navigate to the vault page manually and enable it in your browser. If you don't, the vault option *will not appear in the app.* It was really confusing when I had to set it up and my friends were telling me 'just go to the vault option in the reddit app lol'. '

Edit 3: Ok i must say, you people are fucking insane! Thank you all!",moon,
t3_meyqip,Why do people hardly upvote posts on here anymore?,moon,
t3_meyqip,"I’ve noticed a significant downtrend in post upvotes lately, to the point where I’ve seen countless decent, useful posts with 100+ comments - yet they have zero upvotes. On pretty much any other sub, posts like that would definitely have got a reasonable amount of upvotes.

What’s causing this?

Is this just people suppressing by downvoting? This frankly makes ZERO sense as so much MOON gets distributed each month across so many members, downvoting will make pretty much ZERO difference to your allocation! That theory is a waste of time.

Maybe people are more precious with their upvotes, again it makes zero sense - upvoting helps people find quality content on this group - that is the whole point of upvotes.

I’m going to actively start upvoting decent, original content - remember, that’s the whole point!

— EDIT FOLLOWING COMMENTS —

- So, one idea that’s been kicked around if possible is a ‘ratio’ check against up and down votes. Would it be possible to allow a certain ratio or rate limit on up and down votes specifically in this sub? Downvote bots would have pretty much all downvotes in this sub. It this too simplistic? In my peabrain this would severely restrict the activity/impact of downvote bots (and those doing it manually!)

- How do you create a proposal for the community - ‘Poll’ post type is not available for me?",moon,
t3_mf0eos,Comprehensive List Of The Most Basic Useful Essentials About Cryptocurrency. *UPDATE* v2.0,moon,
t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**. 

*Nobody will tell you truly, how to get rich. They want to make rich off you !*

Some of us are watching YouTube, to do his own DYOR, to lean one someone’s else’s opinion, to find a motivation, to learn more about projects. When you don’t know where to look for research, YouTube may came to your mind. While some of the YouTubers are providing some good Technical Analysis, others are making use of their own subscribers  for their own good.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###EXCHANGES

Simply, Exchanges are Platforms. Platforms that we’re using every day to trade our cryptocurrencies for other assets, including either FIAT or digital currencies. They act as **intermediary** between the seller and the buyer. For this job, we’re paying them the transaction fees or commissions.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

&amp;#x200B;

[Moons per karma point](https://preview.redd.it/0ekr2xsensp61.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb47ff8c7d4d393c9abecc5ac7219c2d656f657)

MOONs really are getting hard to be earned. As usual there is a 17% decrease compared to round 10 but this is less than round 10 as round 10 was 40% less than round 9. I suspect banning low quality posts reduced number of users earning karma so this round is more rewarding per karma for a user.

# Number of Vaults :

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Number of Vaults](https://preview.redd.it/8d2yb03hnsp61.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c115f606297cb132f13c01d0aae5bc0857d271a7)

Although number of vaults at round 10 were at an all time high, The number of vaults at round 11 **IS TOO DAMN HIGH**. More people are creating their vaults and moving a step closer to getting their own lambos or should I say, Teslas ?.

# Average MOONs users earned :

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[MOONs earned per user](https://preview.redd.it/eykokcajnsp61.png?width=776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d7c63bdeef0095c271e5521836ade4d39d9af2a)

This perfectly lines up with the huge rise in number of vaults. Although this time it isn't too much of high change, the number only dropped by 3. I think many people stopped being active in the sub, so existing and still active users are earning more.

# Average MOONs moderators earned :

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[MOONs earned per Moderator](https://preview.redd.it/2lu4wfclnsp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a3aa295f101215cf99554fa5da93b4ec8704a6)

Well, moderators too are earning less moons. There is almost a 31% decrease compared to round 10.

# MOON bags distribution :

&amp;#x200B;

[Number of users with MOON ranges](https://preview.redd.it/infmia0onsp61.jpg?width=990&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e2310e4340158e1054115151a108218b7868c40)

All levels of moon ranges have an increased number of people. More users have plowed their way into the &gt;1000 group. And. there's also an increase of 128% in 0 to 10 range suggesting more newbies don't have their vaults set up. NEWCOMERS PLEASE SETUP YOUR VAULTS!

# Price per moon (USD):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[What is this moonstrosity? 1 MOON = 1 MOON](https://preview.redd.it/jhwa47qqnsp61.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60d354ea543d1c23db9a1482bb63fb64ca833d58)

# TL;DR?

**For round 11,**

&amp;#x200B;

|***Name***|*Value*|*% Change relative to round 10*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Moons given per karma point|0.422|18% Decrease|
|Number of vaults|17018|128% Increase|
|Average moons user earned|47.27|6% Decrease|
|Average moons mods earned|662.92|31% Decrease|
|Price of moons|0.0656|1 Moon = 1 Moon|

t3_mfh10c,PROPOSAL: Revising the Rules for Video Uploads.,moon,
t3_mfh10c,"\*\*The purpose of this proposal was given a lot of thought with the help from others \*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Many members would like to see high effort comedy videos again, but WITHOUT all of the low quality spam.

&amp;#x200B;

The previous solution pushed all comedy to r/ccmemes. This indirectly affected all of the people who put in a lot of effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Bellow details a list of measures to be taken to allow video submissions followed by a list of ways this will filter out all the low quality meme postings. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Details of Revision\*\*:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Image posts are still not allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Only one Video Upload per week

&amp;#x200B;

\* Special Memberships Only

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How will this stop all spam/low effort memes?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The fee for special membership is 1,000 Moons a month.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Any user or bot who comes to this sub to spam, or moon farm with low quality crap would realize quickly the obstacle that has to be overcome before being allowed. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* They would have to first earn 1000 moons the right way, then give up all those moons only to be allowed to post one video a week(no images).

&amp;#x200B;

\* With only a total of 4 per month, each upload  would have to obtain 550 Up votes to barely break even on next months 1000 moon membership costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* It just wouldn't be worth it for spammers, or moon farmers to take advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Limited to one per week, special members would also not want to waste their only shot that week on a low effort gif.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With these strict rules in place, we are allowing the subreddit to once again enjoy the high quality shit it deserves from time time without seeing endless arrays of BS low effort/farming memes\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Vote away!

&amp;#x200B;

This will last 5 days.

t3_mf7jtr,What was the coin that got you into the cryptocurrency world?,moon,
t3_mf7jtr,"I find this quite interesting, as most people that I ask about why they joined they mainly say “I first got bitcoin, but I ended up swapping it” or similar outcome.

It’s safe to say most of us have purchased Bitcoin at least once in our lives (whether you hodled or sold or swapped, that is up to you - I was a massive noob in crypto so I bought and swapped it for Ethereum later, swallowing a massive fee).

My question is, apart from bitcoin... what is your main crypto coin? No shilling - just the reasons why you said “yes, this is the future”.

I reckon this could be a good topic to help newbies see we are not here just asking wen lambo or wen moon (we are too, though).

I’ll start: I first learnt of crypto when I opened my Revolut account, and after seeing the cool Ethereum icon, I decided to see what it was about and bought bitcoin because I thought I had to firstly buy bitcoin to be able to buy any other tokens lmao.",moon,

It started with meme weekends, then, crypto success stories typically referring to buying something with crypto to give to someone in need, their family, themselves, etc. People caught on to the same-y sob stories and heart throbs, so now it’s more of a, creative-writing exercise to see who can make the most believable/and/or controversial post.

t1_gsmw2mo,"It’s a bit higher cap than typical moonshots, but IOTA is something else with their technology. It’s riskier, but because of how unique and different they are, there are really no other alternatives. Think of nano with smart contracts and NFT. fast, feeless, and decentralized (come coordicide later this year). They’re just about to jump into their 2nd to last major milestone of chrysalis which is “2.0” and final build. This introduces oracles, sharding, “colored tokens” which I’m not too knowledgeable on yet, but I think is the basis for NFTs and tokens on the iota network. So because of how ambitious it is, and not being fully complete yet, it’s riskier. But if they succeed, I’m stoked to see how it changes crypto. They could very well fail and hit set backs, which in my opinion will kill all trust and any future potential. But they’re on good track and have good communication. So so far so good it seems. And if they do succeed, they’ll become a monster imo. Truly moon or 0.

Basically you earn moons from Karma once a month but there is a few things that determine how much you will earn.

Edit: Forgot the most important part! If you are on the reddit app go to your profile and activate the Moon vault! 

Iirc you can only do it on the app and you have 6 months to claim your moons in the vault.

Post Karma - Each upvote/downvote has 1 karma, unless it is a meme or media, then it is 10%.


Comment Karma - Each comment upvote/downvote gets 2 karma since the there was a proposal to make comments give 2x karma that passed.


Karma limit - limit of 1000 karma per post or comment.

When do you get the moons? - Moons are distributed every 4 weeks 

What is the current ratio? - The ratio normaly get lower each month for an example last one was 0.42 which means 1 Karma equals to 0.42 moons, the one before that was 0.52 and the one before that was 0.87.


Proposal regarding moons that got accepted.


20% bonus : If you don't move out your moons, you get +20% on next 
distribution.


5% voting bonus : This one is passed but not official yet. If you vote on proposals, you'll get +5% on next distribution.

Posts with the comedy flair only get 10% of the Karma earned from that post.

You can also look up moons on Coingecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon ) 

To see how much they are worth and where they are listed, and the total supply of moons that will be released (out of 250m around 60m is 'released')

Edit: The ratio is dynamic and don't necessary have to get lower but considering it went lower the last 5-6  month i assume it will continue get lower.

Edit 2: Apperently a few cant see/activate their vault and some nice fella posted this 

'Should also note; you'll have to get the official reddit app (gross) and then also navigate to the vault page manually and enable it in your browser. If you don't, the vault option *will not appear in the app.* It was really confusing when I had to set it up and my friends were telling me 'just go to the vault option in the reddit app lol'. '

t3_meyqip,Why do people hardly upvote posts on here anymore?,one,
t3_meyqip,"I’ve noticed a significant downtrend in post upvotes lately, to the point where I’ve seen countless decent, useful posts with 100+ comments - yet they have zero upvotes. On pretty much any other sub, posts like that would definitely have got a reasonable amount of upvotes.

What’s causing this?

Is this just people suppressing by downvoting? This frankly makes ZERO sense as so much MOON gets distributed each month across so many members, downvoting will make pretty much ZERO difference to your allocation! That theory is a waste of time.

Maybe people are more precious with their upvotes, again it makes zero sense - upvoting helps people find quality content on this group - that is the whole point of upvotes.

I’m going to actively start upvoting decent, original content - remember, that’s the whole point!

— EDIT FOLLOWING COMMENTS —

- So, one idea that’s been kicked around if possible is a ‘ratio’ check against up and down votes. Would it be possible to allow a certain ratio or rate limit on up and down votes specifically in this sub? Downvote bots would have pretty much all downvotes in this sub. It this too simplistic? In my peabrain this would severely restrict the activity/impact of downvote bots (and those doing it manually!)

t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

##NOTE TO ALL :
**This Comprehensive List Of All The Basic Useful Threads** should only be used for an educational purposes **ONLY**. I am not forcing anyone to listen, read and use these posts for your present and future investments. In my opinion we should learn from them. Otherwise, use this list as a white paper/ starting point on your journey, not as your “get rich quick scheme” or “business plan”.

t3_mfh10c,PROPOSAL: Revising the Rules for Video Uploads.,one,
t3_mfh10c,"\*\*The purpose of this proposal was given a lot of thought with the help from others \*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Many members would like to see high effort comedy videos again, but WITHOUT all of the low quality spam.

&amp;#x200B;

The previous solution pushed all comedy to r/ccmemes. This indirectly affected all of the people who put in a lot of effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Bellow details a list of measures to be taken to allow video submissions followed by a list of ways this will filter out all the low quality meme postings. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Details of Revision\*\*:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Image posts are still not allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Only one Video Upload per week

&amp;#x200B;

\* Special Memberships Only

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How will this stop all spam/low effort memes?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The fee for special membership is 1,000 Moons a month.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Any user or bot who comes to this sub to spam, or moon farm with low quality crap would realize quickly the obstacle that has to be overcome before being allowed. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* They would have to first earn 1000 moons the right way, then give up all those moons only to be allowed to post one video a week(no images).

&amp;#x200B;

\* With only a total of 4 per month, each upload  would have to obtain 550 Up votes to barely break even on next months 1000 moon membership costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* It just wouldn't be worth it for spammers, or moon farmers to take advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Limited to one per week, special members would also not want to waste their only shot that week on a low effort gif.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With these strict rules in place, we are allowing the subreddit to once again enjoy the high quality shit it deserves from time time without seeing endless arrays of BS low effort/farming memes\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Vote away!

&amp;#x200B;

This will last 5 days.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date, since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a lot of people are moving to Binance.

There are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They need to do something else to survive.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

I'm resting and I hope I didn't infect people close (like my parents :().

I spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen  and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS have helped me a lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon :()

 One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE

Disclaimer: Even when MOONS are nice and have helped me a lot, I don't  post these updates for that (Moon-farming) I have been doing that for  years a long time ago before MOONS where a thing.

t3_mf7x77,"Changing perspective on ""not your keys, not your coins""",one,
t3_mf7x77,"I’m a big believer in the “not your keys not your coins” mantra that is popular in this sub. I store almost all my crypto on a hardware wallet, and only keep a small amount on reputable exchanges. 

That being said, I recently had a conversation with a friend that began to change my perspective on the matter. Essentially, his argument boils down to the following points:

The technical details of who “owns” the coins doesn’t matter as much as some people would lead you to believe. The large majority of people just want to earn money from crypto, and at the end of the day most should store them in the place where they are least likely to lose their funds. (Obviously there are  exceptions to this rule, for instance if you use participate in DeFi, need your private keys to stake, etc, or actively use your crypto for purchases). You can feel superior by having your own hardware wallet, but if you were told that you were 1.5x more likely to lose your funds, would you still use one?

Now that 1.5x number is completely made up as it’s hard to quantify the exact relative risk, but you hear far more stories of people having their keys stolen or lost than of reputable exchanges being hacked (keyword being \*reputable\*, don’t store anything on shady/small exchanges). Do I trust myself more than a $100B tech company who’s business is dependent on not getting hacked? 

Furthermore, if you lose your own keys, you’re 100% screwed. If Coinbase got hacked, they have some insurance and would likely try and refund their customers (perhaps in USD), or else they would surely go out of business. And I know some exchanges wouldn’t do this, but the major players have insurance, billions of assets under management, and deep pockets from funding as well.

Honestly, I think it was a good argument that made me start to rethink how I store my crypto. I’ll still use a hardware wallet for likely the majority of my crypto, but will consider splitting up my funds more evenly. 

I fully expect this to be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I do think the issue isn’t completely black and white. At the very least, storing some crypto on a major legit exchange is a way to hedge against my own stupidity.",one,
t3_mf7po5,"Bitcoin dominance currently sits at 61%. On January 13, 2018, Bitcoin dominance hit an all time low of 35%.",one,
t3_mf7po5,"**What is bitcoin dominance?**

[Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) is bitcoin's marketcap dividend by the marketcaps of all cryptocurrencies combined. It shows how much value bitcoin has versus the all cryptos combined. This is important because it shows the relative strength of altcoins over time. For most of bitcoin's lifetime (pre-2017), dominance sat at over 98%. Bitcoin was the entire market. But since the first altcoin boom in 2017, it has never come close to that peak again.

**Why did it happen?**

There are a few reasons why bitcoin value relative to the rest of the crypto market fell so dramatically in 2017. One major reason was the bitcoin cash fork that occurred in July 2017. Bitcoin cash gained momentum throughout late as the ""true"" bitcoin because of miner support while bitcoin was suffering from network congestion and high fees. There were calls that ""the flippening"" was going to occur in early 2018 and there would be a mass exodus of bitcoin supporters moving to bitcoin cash. This never ended up happening and bitcoin cash rapidly fell off after this point. 

Another reason was that other established altcoins at the time like eth, litecoin, dash and monero had huge rallies and hit their all time highs versus bitcoin. While they are similar prices today against the USD, they are still well off their all time highs vs. bitcoin.

The third reason was the first ICO boom. Hundreds of new ICOs hit the market from late 2017 and early 2018. Today we are seeing a similar boom of new ICOs and shitcoins hitting the market.

**What does this mean?**

Bitcoin dominance sitting at 65% means that alt season could run for quite a bit longer. If we see another nosedive of bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance going back below 50% would mean that altcoin values would have gained hundreds of billions in value. While the altcoin market has absolutely surged over 2021, its still far from its all time highs in early 2018. I think the altcoin market will continue to boom.",one,
t3_mey1y7,Stop checking your portfolio: the statistics and psychology behind explained,one,
t3_mey1y7,"This will be a boiled down argument for why you should stop checking your portfolio hourly, daily and even weekly - and what intense portfolio-looking does to you.

1. The biggest and easiest to explain factor is glaringly obvious when explained and it comes down to statistics. If you expect 100% gains during a 1 year investment, it will not go up all the time during those 525.600 minutes of the year. At best, it will be up from the last minute, maybe 10.000 times more than it will be down. Say you check bitcoins price every minute 51/100 times it will be up (this is even generous). This is important, because og the theory in psychology that states losses cause more hurt than gains reward in terms of happiness.

But if you check daily instead of per minute, you might be up 200/365 days. That’s significantly up from 51/100. Now if you check monthly, you might be up 8/12 og 9/12 months (from the last month) assuming a 100% expected yearly return. (This is a high apy, but still applies to a low one, but let’s be real, if ur in bitcoin you expect high returnand volatility)

If you are a holder believing in bitcoin, you’re better off checking as few times as possible since variances in prices on daily candles are insignificant compared to the long term, and what you are seeing is the outcome of randomness. When you factor in the psychology of loss and gain, your mental will lose every time when checking often. By checking the price monthly or twice monthly, what you see is bitcoins actual price movement and not the result of daytraders random results.

2. Becoming too invested in your investment. Dedicating your time to checking your portfolio also takes time away from other productive things (or even just watching tv). If you’re not planning on changing your investment, there’s no reason to be checking it often since no matter how many times you do so, it’s still going to be the same price in 1 month as if you didn’t check. Spend that time watching tv instead, it’s better than wasting time watching random outswings in price.

3. Being down from your ATH is frustrating. 
By checking bitcoins price often, you make sure you will be seeing the price being DOWN from the ATH 99% of the time. If you check it less, chances are you still won’t be seeing the ATH.. but instead of being 15% down from ATH you shift your focus to being up 10% since you checked last month.
This third reason could vary from person to person with it being insignificant to some people.


TL;DR:
By checking your portfolio often, you’re just checking the results of daytraders random outcome. Checking less often gives you a clearer indication of bitcoins actual price moment. 

Psychological principles say losses hurt more than wins gain - leaving your unconscious mood to be decided by daytraders is probably not in your interests when investing in bitcoin. 

Check less often for higher chance of being up from when you last checked to be affected less by random, insignificant price actions. This applies if you’re a bitcoin bull in a bull market.",one,
t3_mfccdg,"OPINION: If Satoshi Nakamoto hasn’t sold any of his coins yet, he never will.",one,
t3_mfccdg,"In their filing for a public listing on the NASDAQ exchange, Coinbase [said](www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/coinbase-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-u-s-cryptocurrency-exchange-11614290534) that one of its major business risks is the entire crypto market being destabilized if Satoshi Nakamoto is ever revealed or sells his holdings.

t3_mfdfiw,Analyze: When the bull market ends? 4 indicators.,one,
t3_mfdfiw,"  

**Short answer: Nobody knows! This is not financial advice.**

Long answer: Nobody knows, but there are some indications. Still not financial advice.

**1 / Market cycle duration**

First bitcoin cycle was around 15 months. Second one was 36 months. Third one was 48 months. So, you could conclude as market cap grows, each cycle becomes slower at accumulating more capital. So far, this cycle has been 26 months from the bottom. If the trend is going to continue, this cycle still has a lot to offer.

**2 / Market cap peak trendline**

If we draw the trendlines from previous cycles ([chart by Peter Brandt CEO of Factor LLC](https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-11.20.35-AM-775x446.png?format=webp)), it seems that we still have room before reaching the peak area. This trendline is based on very few data points, but if the market is going to behave the same way, it appears that we are in in the middle of the current cycle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbfijdSZAU) for more info. 

**3 / Ratio between long-term holders to short-term holders.**

In simple terms, in the last bull-markets short-term holders increased and long-term holders decreased to certain levels when we approached the end of market cycle. [In this chart](https://i.imgur.com/eGEwsHQ.png) you can see this ratio (and the [mathematics behind it](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/rhodl-ratio/)), going to red area indicates that we are near the end of cycle.

**4 / Stock to flow model**

For 'store of value' commodities there has been a useful model which has predicted the value of assets like gold and silver. Since bitcoin behaves similarly, it has been successful at predicting bitcoin too. Each time the real price deviated from the model; it went back to it. Right know we are very close to [the model’s prediction](https://i.imgur.com/Lpe3Kbz.png), which could indicate a rather “fair value”.

In the end, it has been always said “[all models are wrong, some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)”. Market is unpredictable, there is a big chance non of this happens. But if we are to guess, this bull market doesn't seem to be finished yet.",one,

I just set up my fault and can’t wait to see how many moons I can generate so I can have a badass username and donate moons to you beautiful people for your hard work. 

My interest in market research has increased exponentially in the last 60 odd days. Last year I only had an investment portfolio run by an automatic broker called Wealthsimple. Had no idea how the market worked besides some very basic economics. Wish I would’ve been involved sooner and could’ve rode this wave up since the pandemic. Since mid Feb I’ve started to become intrigued and opened a trade account to invest my money that was otherwise sitting in my bank account or a drawer. 

Fast forward to a week ago when my buddy and I talked about our recent interest in investing our money with trading. We finished our chat with him recommending I look into cryptocurrency (should this be all one word?). I’ve spent most of my spare time researching block chain technology, the difference of PoS and PoW networks, crypto wallets, and everything else in between. I’m barely scratching the surface of what there is to understand but this community is accelerated my ability to do so! I’ve saved so many posts and I’m going back and reading through all the thorough DD from so many different sources. 

Anyway this is mostly just an appreciation post from a new member to the community. I look forward to being able to bring some friends into this group and bring more hype about crypto and this digital revolution!

t3_mffksj,Apps To Earn Crypto,one,
t3_mffksj,"I am relatively new to all of this, and I have not had spare money to buy crypto, so I have had to rely on stuff like moons in this subreddit, tips, faucets, drops, and apps to earn bits of free crypto here and there. I wanted to mention some of the apps I have used and see if you all had others that you recommend. I have an Android, so I do not know if these are on Apple or not. 

**Quicrypto** and **TipNano**

These two are similar that they both allow you to earn crypto through watching ads, doing surveys, or using other apps/playing games. They do have slight differences. In Quicrypto you accumulate generic points, which can be redeemed for Nano or Bitcoin. TipNano only allows you to get Nano and has a longer initial setup, however it also has a faucet within the app that you use every couple of hours, and you get small bonuses for opening the app daily. 

Quicrypto has a Piggy Bank that appears to be a one time deal (if you can activate it again, I do not know how.) It accumulates bonus points until you break it open. 

Some of the offers they use include Playtime Offers, which reward you for playing games. You download mobile games and get rewarded just for having the app open, though there is a diminishing return. At first, new apps reward you every few minutes, but that increases gradually until you are getting nothing until the app has been open for an hour or two. 

I believe Theorem Surveys and InBrain Surveys seem like decent survey sites that give rewards even if you don't qualify for a survey, so your time doesn't feel wasted. 

**WeNano**

WeNano is like a super simplified Pokemon Go. There are spots on a real world map. If you are within range, you can enter the spot and get Nano. However, the app seems to be a bit slow, in my experience. 

While there are not currently many spots available, if you zoom out, click on the filter, and turn off everything except Show Special, you should be able to find one or two large spots that you fit in. There is a World spot just NW of Hawaii that you can claim daily. And many countries or continents have a spot as well. I know the US has a weekly spot, as does Central America. 

**Bitcoin games by Bling**

Bling has made 5 pretty basic mobile games (Bitcoin Blocks, Food Fight, Solitaire, Blast, and Pop) that reward points that can be redeemed for very small amounts of Bitcoin on Coinbase. Your account can be connected to all of the games, so you can see your total number of points. You can redeem them for Bitcoin once per week. The games have a stamina system, and your ""lives"" refill every 12 hours.  From what I can tell, points are not awarded based on performance in the game. It kinda seems random.

Bitcoin Food Fight seems like the fastest app if you aren't interested in any of the games themselves, but it is pretty repetitive. 

*You end up having to watch a lot of ads.*

**Merge Cats** and **Merge Dragons**

By Sergey Zasorin in the app store. Both of them say Earn Crypto Reward or Earn Cryptocurrency after the name. These games are exactly the same with a different skin. They are super simple. They award a crypto called SOUL, which seems to currently be worth about 0.34 dollars per 100 SOUL. They seem to be working on another game. I have not tried to redeem or trade this currency, yet, so I do not know how smooth the process is. It seems you can stake on their website if you get up to 50,000 SOUL. 


I tried a couple other apps like Crypto Connect 3 that awards Phoneum and Green Karma but was not really impressed with either one. 

**TLDR:** These apps do *not* rake in currency, but if you are bored or waste time with shitty mobile apps anyway, you might be interested? Or maybe you have a recommendation with more promise?

t3_mfch3u,Actually unpopular opinion : Venezuela is not a Bitcoin usecase. Hyperinflation was a byproduct of oil price crashing leading to diminished importation and scarce goods. Money printing was only the final nail in the coffin. A quick recap on the Venezuelan situation and how inflation works.,one,
t3_mfch3u,"Venezuela is often mentioned as a Bitcoin usecase, pointing out that the relentless Bolivar printing caused hyperinflation and Bitcoin could fix this. While partially true, it's not the whole picture.

First you gotta know that Venezuela almost doesn't produce ANY of the goods they consume. EVERYTHING that the population eat, drink, and use everyday is from importation. Second, Venezuela's main exportation activity is oil as it is one of the biggest oil reserve in the world (90+% of the country's exportations is oil), so Venezuela basically trades its imported good for its oil (simplification, there is some forex dynamics behind this). 

Now since 2008, oil price have been crashing. In addition, Venezuela's oil production have been diminishing more and more. Add to that economic sanctions from the US like various embargos and political maneuvers, and what happens?

Goods become scarce. Revenue from oil exportation does not cover the cost of importation needs anymore. In addition your previous partners now refuse to trade with you anymore. Food, consumables, everything : there now isn't enough for everybody and you have to fight for it. 

Now one puny band-aid Maduro tried to use was money printing. In normal times, money printing either increase production or increase prices. When there is more money around, people either buy more stuff which companies respond to by increasing production, or the production of said stuff is already saturated so price rise. In a healthy economy (the US for example), the main impact is on production, which boost the whole economy further more and makes the country more powerful : that's why Central Banks are so addicted. That's the reason consumer inflation does not follow the money supply increase in the US, but instead the money goes into stocks as companies thrive from the increased consumption. 

Now back to Venezuela. Money printing can't make the oil wells produce more, which is Venezuela's most prominent business. Of course it does not increase importation either... So the only effect it could have was price increase on the goods, which became very scarce due to the aforementioned problems. Money printing could have been a solution if the economic crisis was a short-lived period as it would have briefly boosted the importation power of the country, but instead in this situation where the problems ran deep, it only made everything worse.

Bitcoin could have fixed the poor economical decisions of Maduro, but it would not have magically fixed the intrinsic problems of Venezuela, which was an economy too dependent on oil and too dependant on foreign importation to sustain itself. 

tl;dr : Venezuela's real problems come from an economy too focused on oil exportation and too dependent on importations, not from its monetary policy. Bitcoin does a lot of thing, but it cannot save the economy of a country that's deeply flawed.",one,

t3_mfebl8,"Bidders say they had many different motivations, including fun, self-promotion and a signal of support for the NFT market.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gtfwdp3z8vp61.png?width=426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a985867329521a2c068e82a0dc49ee7e77d82528

I’ve had some strange experiences in my career as a journalist. But nothing even remotely prepared me for the experience of watching total strangers competing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a picture of my words.

A few weeks ago, I decided to write a column about the rise of nonfungible tokens, the hottest craze in the cryptocurrency world, with a meta twist: I would [turn the column itself into a NFT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html) and put it up for auction, with the proceeds going to The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund.

When I pitched the idea to my bosses, I thought the stunt might attract a handful of bids from curious Times readers who had spare Ethereum, the cryptocurrency being used for the auction, burning a hole in their digital wallets. Maybe we’d raise a few hundred dollars for charity and explain the complicated process of creating and selling NFTs along the way. I set the auction’s minimum price low — 0.5 Ether, or about $800 — and was nervous I might not get even that much.

Instead, the auction became a circus. I listed it on Wednesday morning, and before I went to bed that night, the top bid had risen to more than $30,000. When I woke up the next morning, it was $43,000. In the final hour of the auction, I watched, slack-jawed, as a last-minute bidding war broke out.

$98,000.

$143,000.

$277,000.

After more than 30 bids, the auction ended at 12:32 p.m. Eastern time, with a [winning bid](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129) of 350 Ether, or about $560,000. A few minutes later, after the auction platform had taken its cut, nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrency landed in my digital wallet. I was stunned. Congratulatory texts and media requests started pouring in. My colleagues joked about stiffing the charity and slipping off to the Cayman Islands. My editor said I shouldn’t expect a raise.

The whole ordeal was surreal, and it raised the question: Why would anyone spend the price of a high-end Lamborghini on a picture of my words? After all, the NFT was just a cryptographic signature linked to an image of a column that anyone could read on The Times’s website, albeit with a few bonus perks. (I also stipulated that I would feature the winner’s name and photo in a follow-up column, and Michael Barbaro, the host of “The Daily,” gamely agreed to throw in a voice message for the winner.)

The winner, whose [handle on the auction site was @3fmusic](https://foundation.app/3FMusic), appeared to be a prominent NFT collector. The profile on the site was linked to a Twitter profile belonging to a Dubai-based music production company, and to an Instagram account identified as that of Farzin Fardin Fard, the company’s chief executive. The user’s NFT collection included a variety of other expensive digital works, including a $14,000 “emoji portrait” of the musician Billie Eilish and a $8,000 piece titled “Jumping Spider enjoying coffee in the morning.”

I reached out to u/3fmusic to offer my congratulations on the purchase and to discuss the bid. They (it’s not clear if the winner is Mr. Fard or some other individual or multiple people) declined to be named — and, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain-based transactions, there’s no easy way for me to identify them beyond the information they volunteered — but they sent me a statement over Twitter direct message that read:

“We are already involved in art and media for a long time now,” the message read. “Our management team is always in cooperation with some highly knowledgeable and experienced art advisers who believe that we must grow with technological movements that help us to not only promote our business but also to support artists and the art market. Thus, we have proudly decided to dedicate sufficient funds and resources to invest in NFT as pioneers of this industry.”

They also gave me permission to include an image of their music studio’s logo in this column.

Jiannan Ouyang, an NFT collector who dropped out of the auction after a high bid of 290 Ether (about $469,000), told me that he had decided to bid on my NFT for both personal and professional reasons. He’s a former Facebook research scientist who is now a blockchain entrepreneur, and he’s married to a journalist.

“This column reflects the thoughts we exchange daily about how the NFT technology will reshape the modern media and advertising industry,” he told me.

Some NFT collectors believe that owning early, prominent crypto-tokens will eventually be like owning rare, first-edition books or priceless paintings. Mr. Ouyang admitted that the value of my NFT was “still highly speculative and subjective.” But he said he believed that NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies would ultimately reshape the entire media landscape, allowing creators to reimagine how they create and monetize their works.

“This particular NFT from The New York Times is one of the answers and will become a historical landmark in this inevitable movement,” he said. “That’s why I think it is valuable.”

Rulton Fyder, a pseudonymous NFT artist who declined to be named, topped out at a bid of 21 ether (about $34,000). He echoed Mr. Ouyang’s thoughts that my NFT might someday have historical significance, and said that beyond the stunts, NFTs were creating a “new digital value system” that was worth taking seriously.

“People from my generation who grow up in the 1970s will love to collect first edition books, novels such as Ulysses by James Joyce,” he wrote in an email. “What crypto and NFT opened up is the ownership of the rights to say one owns such a thing, whether tangible or intangible, in a form that thousands if not millions can see and track the ownership in real time, anywhere in the world.”

André Allen Anjos, an electronic musician from Portland, Ore., who bid 5.69 Ether (about $9,200) on the NFT, told me in a phone interview that bidding on the token could be seen as a symbolic gesture of thanks from the crypto community to me and The Times for, essentially, taking them seriously enough to experiment with our own token sale.

“It’s like, here’s a mainstream publication trying to interact with us as a community in an earnest and real way,” he said. “I wanted to signal, ‘Hey, this is cool, you’re asking the right questions.’”

Mr. Anjos said he had grown up in the era of Napster, when musicians first realized that the internet could destroy their livelihoods by making it free and easy to duplicate songs. Blockchain technology, he said, had changed that by making it possible to create limited-edition collectibles stamped with a digital marker of their provenance.

Collecting NFTs, Mr. Anjos said, was less about owning the pieces themselves — most of which can be freely downloaded from the internet, albeit without their special cryptographic signatures — and more about signaling belief in this new model of ownership.

“I’m not going to call it a protest, but it’s a statement,” he said. “This is the crypto world trying to prove that we’re here, we care about revolutionizing this entire model, and we’re willing to put our money on it.”

“My thinking was: Maybe a photoshop of my face, or some type of super pro-Bitcoin ‘you stuck it to The New York Times’ thing,” he said.

Bidding on NFTs, he said, had become a kind of sport among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, many of whom have been sitting on huge virtual piles of Ethereum and Bitcoin for years. Every NFT auction produces a public record of bids, and high-profile auctions can attract a crowd of people just hoping to be noticed among the losers.

“The bid itself is becoming marketing,” he said.

But Mr. Agrawal clarified that some bids were less strategic, and more about showing off.

“A lot of the NFT buyers at this high level are fabulously wealthy, and they’re just collecting for the sake of collecting,” he said.

In addition to readers who eagerly followed along with the NFT auction, I did got some questions from people who worried about the environmental impact of promoting NFTs that use the Ethereum blockchain. (The Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, requires vast computational power, and [critics have called it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) an emerging environmental hazard.) I fully support developing less computationally intensive ways to do blockchain transactions, and to mitigate any harmful effects of this experiment, I’m personally buying $400 in carbon offset credits — enough to offset about 100 times as many carbon emissions as I generated by auctioning off this NFT.

And as soon as I can figure out how to do the transaction without completely screwing up my taxes, I’ll be sending roughly 300 Ether — worth about $497,000, at the current market price — [to the Neediest Cases Fund](https://www.nytimes.com/column/neediest-cases).

t3_mfds1t,"EDIT:


For any of you BitcoinCash holders: [there's a project that uses BCH in Venezuela for this exact purpose](https://eatbch.org/venezuela/), so for anyone that wants to donate using BCH you can do so with that link! The EatBCH project is one run by Venezuelans and uses these donations to buy meals for the locals. They have already provided thousands of meals and every penny helps!

EatBCH also operates in South Sudan through a different team, so if you want you can donate to them as well through the same website. Link: https://eatbch.org/south-sudan/
_______


I'm not a Nano shill and don't own any as an investment, but can't we all chip in and use WeNano to make spots in Venezuela and donate crypto to locals?

Venezuelans are going through a very rough time and due to inflation their minimum wage is currently only 1 USD *a month* and a family needs roughly 300 USD a month to survive. Due to the extreme inflation a lot of Venezuelans have already turned to crypto, so we could reach a lot of people with this. If we can chip in even a couple of bucks we can really help people who need every penny to survive. 

You can donate a certain amount to the spots you pick or make, pick the radius up to 10km so an entire city can access it, and locals in that spot can only take the limited amount that you set (so nobody can just snatch thousands) which can be a couple of bucks or more. There's a minimum of 0.1 Nano per spot so that's about $0.45 and that's enough to help!

We have all been lucky to see some amazing gains over the past months, so maybe it's time to give something back. If the people over at WallStreetBets can donate to worthy causes than so can/should we!

I'm not really that experienced with WeNano and have only just started using the app, so maybe someone else can do a write up in the comments on how to use it, so for the time being [here's a video explaining how it works](https://youtu.be/T5UKQksjVlE). You can download the app on your phone via the playstore/appstore, but with all the scammy apps on there I'd advise you to follow the links via their official website: https://wenano.net/

(Please point out if I'm wrong about any of this. I have only just downloaded WeNano for this purpose so I'm pretty new as well)

t3_mf0ohx,Best ways to put your BTC into a passive income,one,
t3_mf0ohx,"This article wants to mainly open a discussion about the best CeFi / DeFi solutions to create value from your BTC bag.

BTC is probably the backbone of many portfolios here, hence is no joke when you choose to stop plain hodling into your cold storage and put your crypto at work producing more crypto: if you decided to get away from the *not your keys, not your coin* golden rule you have to put into serious consideration the benefits and risks. That quote is one of the best pieces of advice, but no dogma.

My personal experience, so far, has been with **BlockFi**, which granted me a 6% APY on BTC (tier1, from 0 to 1 BTC [the rates will change from the 1st of April](https://blockfi.com/our-btc-and-eth-rates-are-changing-and-heres-why)). I chose it for the emphasis on security, for being straightforward: no need to lock or to hold a platform coin, and for the possibility of letting me choose the cryptocurrency in which I could receive interest payments (which allowed me to mainly switch from BTC to ETH payouts when the circumstances were favorable or I wanted to rebalance my portfolio).

But this is not a BlockFi post, on the contrary, as I wrote earlier, Tier2 rates have been changed and heavily penalized. Other interesting possibilities I can find in the CeFi environment are **Nexo** (probably the most interesting, we start at 6% at the base loyalty level, but only if you choose to receive payouts in NEXO tokens, otherwise it's 4%), **Celsius** (5,10% if you choose the payout in CEL, otherwise in-kind reward rate is 4,06% APY - edit: US rates are different and provide a compelling 6,2% till 2 btc and 4,06% after) and **Crypto.com**, which are recently doing some interesting steps forward, between the 70 Billion CRO burned last month and the mainnet launched 3 days ago, aiming to decentralize the coin. In the latter, the APY can vary from 1,5% to 8,5% depending on the locked period and CRO staking.

On the DeFi side, you'll need to first tokenize your BTC, which will have to be converted in an erc-20 token before dedicating yourself to yield farming. wBTC and renBTC are examples of 1:1 BTC pegged tokens.

Some interesting options in the DeFi environment, can be found on **Curve** where, according to Coinmarketcap, the hBTC-wBTC pool grants a 7,62% APY, payout in CRV, with low impermanent loss: Another option is the **Harvest Finance** wBTC vault, with a lofty APY of 17,91%, payout in FARM and CRV, and still low IL, but at the same time a higher risk profile ( it's worth noticing that this DeFi protocol was hacked last October 2020 with 24M stolen).

This is a very fast overview, coming from my personal experience and research, with the risk/reward ratio to be always kept in mind. However, my main goal here is to open a discussion about your experience on BTC yield farming and CeFi/DeFi tools, being the brainstorming coming from this community always helpful. Personally, once I will feel more comfortable with DeFi, I will opt for decentralized protocols, being decentralization the reason why crypto is crypto.

Edit: check also the **Badger.finance**, a decentralized organization/community driven project (DAO), focused on BTC farming, with its BADGER token and two products: Sett (vault, DeFi aggregator with flash loans mitigation measures) and DIGG (non custodial synthetic BTC).

[Session 6 Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m60zkf/taking_genslers_blockchain_and_money_mit_course/?)

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues

t3_mexb51,"What are NFTs? And what can you do with them? In this post I’ll try to answer these questions.

# What is an NFT?

If you want to understand the concept of NFT, you must first know what a Fungible token is. NFT stands for Non-Fungible token. An important property of a fungible token or “normal” token is that they are interchangeable - You can exchange bitcoins with each other, the value is equally divisible for everyone - bitcoins can be divided into parts and you can exchange them. For example: 0.003240000 BTC.

An important difference with the Fungible tokens is that the NFTs have a unique aspect and cannot be replicated. This unique aspect is encoded in the token's metadata. Think of it as a certificate of authenticity.

## Some features of NFTs:

* They are unique, this allows you to identify items with them.
* They are not divisible.

The latter has the advantage that you can only claim right to a certain product, service or other object such as an art object. Compared to a real-life example; a football ticket for the match is for one person. You cannot share this ticket with multiple people. There is one seat available for you in the grandstand.

## What can you do with NFTs?

The NFTs have already entered the gaming industry. However, there are plenty of applications to come up with in other situations as well. Think of; birth certificate, diploma, or ID. All these unique items can be ""tokenized"". Tokenizen is digitizing a certain asset and linking it to the blockchain, such as art.

## NFTs vs normal tokens

Another difference between normal tokens and NFTs is the protocol they run on. The normal tokens run on the Ethereum protocol: ERC-20.

For Non-fungible tokens there is a choice of two protocols: ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Of which ERC-721 is the most used. ERC-1155 is slightly newer and less used.

The ERC-1155 protocol has been developed to enable developers to implement this protocol in a smart contract in a smart and efficient way. This can then be used to generate unlimited fungible (identical) tokens and non-fungible (unique) tokens.

The ERC-721 protocol, on the other hand, is used to generate non-exchangeable tokens, forcing developers to implement a new smart contract for each new token.

## Non-fungible tokens and gaming: Crypto Kitties

A well-known example using ERC-721 tokens is Crypto Kitties. Each ERC-721 token in that game is a unique digital cat.

You can breed these with the help of another digital cat and create new cats. The new cats can then be bought and sold on the platform.

## Decentraland

Another good example of a platform that utilizes NFT's is Decentraland. The name already gives it away: it is a (virtual) world that is completely ""built"" on blockchain. It can be compared to Simcity: you buy a virtual piece of land, on which you can build and develop whatever you want. Nobody decides what you can build, you are completely free. In addition to buying virtual land, you can also trade other unique assets with other players in the form of NFTs.

## Ethernity chain

Ethernity Chain, a new player to the game, is developing a community-centric platform for digital artists to create limited edition NFT lines. Ethernity Chain enables users to own unique digital artifacts and artwork, which are tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This is of particular appeal to the gaming, music and sports industries. However, the scope for NFTs is unprecedented. Ethernity Chain addresses this with the use of Authenticated non-fungible tokens (ANFTs).

## NFTs in the future: What can you expect from them

One development in which NFTs can play a major role is DeFi. Decentralized Finance. This topic has been growing in popularity in recent years. And the Non-Fungible tokens can play a supporting role in this.

Let's look at an example: a car accident. Two different parties. Two different insurance companies that have to sort everything out among themselves. They need to collect all data. This is a lot easier via the blockchain, because everything is linked. An NFT may contain data about an insurance policy or car. Link smart contracts to this, and you know: you don't have to think about anything yourself. The blockchain will solve it for you.

## Final words

In this post, you’ve learned that non-replaceable tokens are unique and have unique properties. This allows them to be associated with a specific item. In addition, items such as artwork, have different values ​​that make it interesting to use NFTs. Especially in the gaming industry, it is becoming more popular to use NFTs.

t3_mewxqj,Serious question: Can I sue Voyager or report to the SEC?,one,
t3_mewxqj,"So, I’ve had about a month to think about this, and I don’t know what to do. 

I typically use Coinbase pro, but wanted to buy ADA and DOT, so I downloaded voyager. I bought these along with a few other coins. In total, without getting too specific, I spent between 3 and 5 thousand dollars.

I used the app for about 3 months, everything seemed to be going well. I really liked the UX of the app, actually. 

One day, I went to check my coins and I was logged off. Usually, it took my Face ID or a passcode to get in to my Home Screen. No big deal, I thought. I keep meticulous records of all my login names/emails, passwords, and recovery codes. 

I typed in my email and password which was accepted then I was sent to the 2fa screen. I opened my Authenticator app but My voyager rotating code of 6 digits wasn’t on there anymore. Weird. I went in to my records and found my recovery code and entered it. This was accepted as valid and a code appeared. 

Unfortunately, the codes did not match and I could not log in. From here, I tried everything under the sun to trouble shoot. I deleted the app and re downloaded it. I made sure my time zones were accurate, etc. 

I emailed customer support about a month ago at this point with no reply. They don’t have a phone number and they specifically state not to email more than once. 

I don’t know what to do. This is a significant amount of money for me. I have thousands of dollars worth of crypto that I can’t access. 

To me, this is unacceptable. From a technical standpoint, I’ve done nothing wrong. This is clearly a account glitch of some kind. I was attracted to crypto partly because I was tired of feeling fed up with banks. And now here I am. 

It’s one thing to make a stupid purchase or lose money in a volatile market, it’s another thing entirely to have a supposedly reputable exchange just take it. 

I’m angry and want access back (to send elsewhere of course, no way I would keep using their service now). I am absolutely willing to put in the time to sue in small claims court. Can I do this?

Does the SEC want to know since I won’t be able to file taxes on this now?",one,
t3_mewytg,Why $8 Billionaire Soros is Investing in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Suddenly [A Short Article],one,
t3_mewytg," 

Opinions on cryptocurrencies are very far apart as of right now. It seems there are fewer people who consider this industry to be a bubble. George Soros is a notorious example in this regard. Earlier this year, he claims Bitcoin is a bubble. It seems that comment helped push the price down, which may have been the plan all along.

## The Curious Case of George Soros

Few people were surprised when [George Soros](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/06/george-soros-makes-spectacular-u-turn-cryptocurrency/) claimed Bitcoin is a bubble. In January of 2018, he described cryptocurrrency as a bubble and a misnomer. Moreover, Bitcoin can’t be labeled as a currency because it’s not a stable store of value. All of these comments hold some sort of truth, but they are not entirely factual either.

The volatility associated with Bitcoin has been well-documented in the past. It seems the year 2018 brings us more of the same,. During the first few months, we have seen a lot of bearish [Bitcoin price](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/08/bitcoin-price-weekly-analysis-btc-usds-upsides-remain-capped/) pressure. George Soros considers this to be one of the biggest drawbacks about Bitcoin. Even so, it is possible his comments are designed to purposefully drive the price down altogether. Wall Street players did not take kindly to the Bitcoin price hitting $19,000 late last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether or not the comments by George Soros attributed to the price decline, is always a big question. It is evident Soros is often considered to be a guru became of his “strategic calls based on macroeconomic conditions”. Even so, claiming Bitcoin is a bubble is perhaps the worst assessment of his career. In fact, it seems he did a complete 180-degree turn on cryptocurrencies altogether.

## The Cryptocurrency Investment Decision

Now that the Bitcoin price has dipped quite a bit, George Soros prepares to invest in cryptocurrency. This rather odd decision only fuels speculation involving price manipulation. Even though George Soros still considers digital currencies to be not “actual currencies”, the volatility has suddenly turned him into a believer. Such a sudden change of heart is often part of a bigger agenda.

For the time being, it seems Soros is quite happy with the way things are going for Bitcoin. With the big dip in place, it seems things may improve from here on out. He is not the first [Wall Street ](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/04/coinbase-adds-another-wall-street-exec-scales-institutional-markets/)mogul to invest in cryptocurrencies either. Alan Howard and the Rothschild family are taking very similar steps in this regard. It seems the interest in cryptocurrency is only growing, even among financial experts.

The big question is whether or not cryptocurrency prices can rebound. Right now, it seems the situation is still brittle, as things can change pretty quickly. Even so, the bearish pressure has been prevalent for a very long time. Sooner or later, things will need to improve again. Bitcoin’s price may very well return to the five-digit range in the future. How long that process will take, is anybody’s guess at this point.

t3_mezre6,"I only very recently entered the crypto space, but have been very aware of bitcoin since 2011 and over the past decade I’ve seen my friends completely change their lives with crypto, So it was time that I finally started investing, things seemed great I was buying every coin my friends told me about and any coin that seemed promising on here,

Now here comes the downside, every coin I bought into was before valentines day, literally every coin was at its ATH and out of my initial $1000 dollars invested I lost hundreds, although I made some of it back over time, nothing was reaching or passing the previous ATH

I was on the fence about investing more because at this point I was scared of potentially loosing more and assumed everyone had shilled me out of my money

Until one night I got on CMC and literally went through the top 600 coins I wrote down every coin with a low market cap and relatively low supply out of those 600 I probably researched 200/300 then I found my two low cap low supply alt coins with crazy potential and solid real world uses, I decided to pull the trigger one last time although one coin was in top 200 and the other was in the top 600, I was then able to triple my investment with one and double my other investment pulling me back in the green and restoring all my hope

t1_gsnhg1h,"**TL;DR:** Gary Gensler's, potential future head of SEC, views on what a security is and my own attempt to see if XRP fits in the categories he mentions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to discuss the potential Security status of XRP according to the SEC. Early this week, I was going through the MIT Course Blockchain and Money, imparted by Gary Gensler ([who is nominated to lead the SEC](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-gensler-biden-s-pick-to-head-sec-approved-by-senate-committee-11615404521)), in which he talks about the securities and what they are. In [Episode 8](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/session-8-public-policy/) at 1:05:50 he shows The Howey Test, a 4-question test to deem if something is a security, which are the following:

\- Is it an investment of money or an asset?

This one seems to be the easiest to answer: you paid dollars or whatever currency to acquire XRP, so ***yes***.

\- Is it an investment on a common enterprise?

As he points, this one might be more difficult to pin down on open-source software but the involvement of Ripple Labs as developers of XRP would make this one another ***yes***.

\- Is there a reasonable expectation of profits?

He mentions investing with the hopes of an appreciation of the asset in the future, which is the case for most people in crypto. So, ***yes***.

\- Is it reliant on the efforts of others?

He doesn't dwell in this one, but as I understand XRP (as all crypto I would say?) is reliant on adoption of the technology by third parties, which would make this one a ***yes***.

He ends quoting the (by then, September 2018) head of the SEC who reckoned all ICO would fill in these categories and be deemed as securities. He mentions this would be less than 25% of the Crypto market.

Any thoughts about this? Am I missing any points?",one,
t1_gsnkt9z,"You’re right, in general, with respect to Genslers analysis. But this was in 2018.

The issue in applying the Howey test is that a digital asset may, at one time, satisfy the test and not at another. This is a fundamental issue that the Court has to deal with.

So whilst it may be arguable that in 2018 it was a security, it is far less arguable that it is today. 

This brings us to the case and the current developments whereby even up to October 2020, the SEC could not advise exchanges whether or not XRP was a security. 

Moreover, it aligns with the comments by the SEC recently that the only sales that they are seeking to preclude are those by Ripple, and not exchanges. 

So I don’t think that Gensler’s comments in 2018 should hold any more value than that it was sound analysis in 2018.",one,

t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”.

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it.

The partnerships are real, but yes you can get lost in the xCurrent xVia xRapid shuffle (two of which do not rely on XRP whatsoever).

Yes, partners are incentivized to use XRP, but that's one of the main reasons they have XRP in escrow anyways (to pay themselves a bit and to pay customers to use it).

For example, storing screenshots on their phone of their private passwords; keeping the wallet app installed on their phone or computer; using the same device they use for entertainment as they do for dealing with wallets; and falling victim to bad actors, such as fake websites, fake apps, fake support, fake giveaways.

However, I believe with proper education people can avoid these pitfalls, and as a result use wallets to keep their coins secure as possible.

Some exchanges are reputable, and some otherwise. The ability for any one person to get on a reputable exchange depends on the region they're from, and also the coins available for purchase plays a major role. It's common for people to end up on less-than reputable exchanges, and it's also common for people to end up on the reputable ones. But for this reason, I believe it's a good rule of thumb that ""Not your keys, not your coins.""

But here's the problem. We'd expect a $100B company to have fantastic security and could avoid getting hacked, but the sad reality is that many of these companies lack the most in cybersecurity. I've seen it time and time again over the years, not just in cryptocurrency, but over the entire sphere of the internet from large to small companies. Having insurance is great, but regulations are not like they are for, say, the stock market. If a severe enough hack were to occur, I'd seriously be concerned over the company's ability to reimburse people. And at the end of the day, we don't really know what's going on behind the scenes of a company, and their internal practices. For example, why do 100B companies tend to have such horrible, horrible support? You'd expect the opposite. In the same way, we can say this for cybersecurity. You'd expect it to be great, but we're in an era where even cybersecurity experts don't know what the heck they're doing, and simply sound good on paper.

But I agree, if someone hasn't taken the time to properly learn about cryptocurrency, and educate themselves, then they can be their own worst enemy. And for this reason, I can see it making a lot of sense to just stick with exchanges. But I always recommend people learn about wallets and safety related to that, and get to a point they can control their own coins fully.

Where do you get the 48 hours from?

With the email account, you can change basically everything on the exchange, e.g. whitelist. Also, there are all kinds of sophisticated attacks especially for crypto transactions, e.g. changing the transaction settings (receiving adress, amount etc) right before you click send or after you copied it to the clipboard. A hardware wallet shows you everything on its own display and no one can change that.

OP's point is that there hasn't yet been a lot of tests for BTC's resilience towards global economic crises with the one example we have showing that BTC is in fact not a good store of value in comparison to gold. Granted, it's not enough to make a solid claim about BTC and there is the fact that BTC as it is now may not be the same as it was a year ago, without all this new institutional backing.

t1_gsm3fn8,"I kind of agree with you. An asset with ten years of life with such an impressive volatility is not a reliable store of value.

A store of value is the gold, when it ""crashes"" it dips a 5%. Compared to cryptocurrencies, those actually are dips for ants.

In the recent story, it has only actually ""crashed"" once during the 2007 crisis, and it recovered quite fast. 

When it comes to cryptos though, it's not uncommon to see 10 and 15% dips or even more. During bear markets, we've seen -80% from ATH, which is kinda scary for a store of value.

You also make a great point, we haven't seen Bitcoin on a bear market yet. Bitcoin itself has been bearish multiple times, however, it has not lived yet a worldwide recession like the 2007 crisis. How would it behave? No one knows, and thus, it's quite hard to claim it being a store of value.",one,

t1_gsmi5v1,"&gt;In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.

So the thing is, you're comparing a relatively brand new asset class in bitcoin which is about 10 years old, to a 5,000 year old asset class in gold. There are many reasons why the comparison you're drawing isn't a fair one. For starters, bitcoin is still in its infancy, or price discovery mode, over the course of the next 100 years at minimum. Once we've mined every last bitcoin and only then, would it be fair to draw a comparison to gold as a store of value, in the way you're doing it. 

Basically, people need to calm down with these comparisons and just let bitcoin do it's thing. This is sortof like comparing a high school Michael Jordan to a prime Magic Johnson. Give bitcoin the time it needs before you draw the comparisons.",one,

Personally and professionally? If or when it crashes, it prolly wont go bellow 20k. 

But to add to the OP’s general idea, as someone who’s actually studied economics, yeah, I wouldn’t go down that road and treat BTC as a store of value. Just because it mimics gold in certain market aspects, it doesn’t make it into a de facto digital gold. Not denying the potential of that, but we are still veeeery far from achieving such goal.",one,

t1_gsn29qv,"I’d like to add on to what /u/Mongo_Az said as I have rental properties as well. One thing he didn’t mention is we’re doing this more as a side gig for extra income on the side. With that said margins are super thin because there are still loans on the rental properties. 

This is what happens for small owners like myself. You buy a fixer upper. Live in it while fixing it up. After a year or so you find another house, see if you qualify for a loan and move out and repeat. Depending on the area if you’re not living in the home you don’t qualify for lower property taxes. In my state they go up 3x. So if your property taxes are 1200 a year, it’ll be 3600 a year or 200+ extra per month. You tag on property management fees and other shit that happens (had to replace a fridge this year) you’re running on razor thin margins. I could myself lucky if I can cover the mortgage for the month. 

Why do we do this then? Glad you asked. 

When the mortgage is paid off we can make a lot more. But keep in mind that’s decades away. And even if we decide to sell due to depreciation, we have to pay capital gains taxes on whatever we sell it at, even at a lost.

Edit:  I’m really interested in tax laws bc it’s kinda crazy how hard reliable information is to come by and I think that’s on purpose.

Your  numbers do mostly check out with one exception. Your data doesn’t take into account the total amount of income earned and effective tax rates. Yes it’s true that the wealthy pay more than the poor as a percentage of taxes, however they pay less now than they ever have in Americans history. Also, as you go higher up in tax brackets the effective tax rates start to go down “... But the system starts to lose its progressivity at the very highest levels: In 2015, the effective rate peaked at 29.3% for taxpayers in the $2 million-to-under-$5 million group, then fell to 28.8% for the $5 million-to-under-$10 million group and 25.9% for those making $10 million or more.”  And to the point I was making. Your number doesn’t take into account income Inequality, the wealthy own the vast majority of income. The top 25 percent of income earners earn a total of 74.9% of all income (2019). In 1967 the top 25 percent earners earned a total of 60.8% of all income.

I don’t think it’s overvalued because it’s delivering today what Cardano and ETH2 promise tomorrow. It was just stress tested at 14M transactions in a single day last week.

This is reckless speculation, but if I’m an institutional investor or decision maker dipping my toes into crypto, the 30-year MIT prof. with a Turing Award is number one on my list of people to get a meeting with.

The project was just launched four years ago and mainnet was just launched in 2019. This is why it isn’t as high as other projects yet. The transaction fees are measured in the thousandths and are instant. There are already millions of NFTs for these copyrights on the chain. 

The market cap is 1/10 of Cardano and it’s delivering value today, not just being hyped. I say this as a fan of Cardano and Charles. There is absolutely no logical reason for Algorand to be lower than Cardano, let alone 10% of the cap. If there is then someone please clue me in.

So basically one person set up hundreds of accounts somehow and got 46 Nano from me. There were some posts about this in the Nano sub and some other community members found the same thing to be the case for their spots in Venezuela.

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really.

t1_gsmu3ay,"I’ll just talk facts regarding D=0 Day for Cardano...

All blocks will be produced by independent stake pools after the current Epoch ends.  With roughly 70% of all ADA in circulation staked, this will make Cardano a very decentralized ecosystem.  There’s also over 2000 stake pools now all over the world.  I’m located in the US, but I actually delegate to pools in Ireland, England, and the US through 3 different wallets.

The price of this event should be baked in to the current price of ADA.  Long time holders have been watching the progress bar towards total block production by the Cardano Community.

Now my opinion...

The Cardano Community is invested into Cardano just like the Ethereum Community is invested into Ethereum.  There’s also many people invested in both.  I see a scenario where both are successful.  If this happens, all of crypto benefits.  The scenarios where one or both fail are actually very bad for the alt coin space as a whole.  The constant bashing of both projects only degrades cryptos as an investment.  You don’t see the suits on Wall Street constantly bashing competitors.  They know it serves no purpose and will not equal winning. What equals winning is beating the competition by making the best product, having the best service, reaching more and more of the population, and being professional as fuck when every one around you is on the playground. Amazon doesn’t bash Walmart.  Amazon improves.  Amazon researches.  And Amazon wins.  They only care about the competition insomuch as to how to stay one step ahead.  Walmart doesn’t say a damn word about Amazon.  They just improve and launch their own 2 day shipping.  Amazon responds by trying next day.

I’m all in ADA with only a scant amount of ETH at the moment but you know what...I’m not afraid to say it...

I hope Ethereum improves.  I hope they solve all of the problems the network has now and in the future.  It will make Cardano always push.  I hope both win.  I hope I win.  And, if you’re all in on Ethereum, I hope you win.",one,

t1_gsm26od,"Take a longer term view.  Make a plan and stick to your plan.  Don't be reactive to the day to day events.  Expect volatility and understand that it can lead you psychologically to make the wrong decisions (e.g., panic selling on dips, panic buying at sharp rises).  Remember that the most successful crypto investors are the dead ones.   Reacting daily, particularly when you're new, is probably a losing strategy.  When you're making a purchase, you should have an idea of if and when you would take profits and how much.  You should also have an idea what you would do if it falls.

Understand and think about your risk tolerance and tailor your plan around it.  Yes, a tiny market cap coin nobody ever heard of has a better chance of going 100x in a single day than the largest market cap coins, but it also has a better chance of dropping to nothing in a day.  Don't put money in that you cannot afford to lose.  Research the coins you're buying.  Trust your (researched) judgment over people you find on the internet.  Understand that when you're hearing a ""crypto celebrity"" on the internet tell you to buy a coin, it's entirely possible it's so they can dump it.

Don't believe anybody who claims they can make precise price predictions over the short term.  Instead, consider dollar cost averaging (DCA).  Take your time and make decisions that you can stand behind.  Don't feel that you need to race into this or you'll miss out (FOMO).

Research and take appropriate security precautions for how you store your crypto.  If you're getting into substantial amounts, don't leave your crypto on an exchange indefinitely.  Make sure you using multi-factored authentication for services you're using that provide it.  Use strong passwords and don't use the same password for different services.  Consider the use of a cold wallet.  Also make a plan for what happens with your crypto if something happens to you.    If someone messages you directly from reddit, there's a good chance it's because they want to try to scam you.  If you're using a hot wallet, be aware there are ""fake"" versions of them sometimes on the app stores.  Make sure you're downloading the official version.  When you're transferring crypto, do it very carefully--i.e., be careful not to transfer from a wallet with one type of coin to a wallet with another type of coin (e.g., from bitcoin to bitcoin cash).  Consider using ""allow-listing"" when using exchanges: i.e., set up the wallets you'd be moving crypto to and restricting transactions to those.  If you are using allow-listing, consider moving a smaller transaction before moving a large amount (yes, you'll lose a little to fees with that method, but it's better than losing your whole stack).  Be careful talking about crypto with friends and family.  Consider the merits of, just, not telling people.

Finally, participate in the /r/cryptocurrency (as you already are).  It's a good time. ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)",one,
t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",one,

t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”. 

Vitalik got what he wanted with Ethereum and Charles got what he wanted with Cardano. The good vs. evil battle that you are making this out to be is an exaggeration that comes from you “picking a side”.",cardano,

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor.

t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",cardano,

It's also a very interesting investment.

I got into BTC relatively late but I'm still well in profit. I'm holding some BTC. I have to laugh when I hear all the HODL-at-all-costs Sufi circle stuff. Same with the ""Bitcoin will change the world"" crowd. At best, they're just trying to pump bags they've been holding for many years. I owe BTC absolutely nothing. None of us do. I am still trying to make the big money that the early BTC buy-and-hold lot did. THAT is the holy grail - the 10x / 100x / 1000x unknown coin that turns out to have a use case and a massive momentum behind it.

BTC has done very, very well as an investment asset over its history. That doesn't mean it will continue to do so.

I tend to find that if the BTC ""true believers"" are right, then BTC is actually a relatively stable store of value. However, that feels like a trap. Nothing is stable. Not even gold. As we know, the price of BTC is vulnerable to whale activity. Whales can crash BTC easily if they want. As a retail investor I don't like that but I'm willing to go along with it as long as the prospect of big gains are there. In other words, big-time tail risks and unknowns are fine with me, as long as it's VOLATILE. And it's not as volatile as it was, is it.

Comparisons with altcoins show that BTC volatility tends to be a lot less than altcoins. This is despite the fact that BTC gets pumped more than any other crypto. Big money goes towards funding Youtube channels, moderating opinions on Reddit, etc. to pump the price of BTC. And what do we see? The next ATH could be a mere 7% upswing, and the same investment into altcoins could have seen a 40% upswing, as we've seen with Cardano recently. Hmmm...

1)A proposal for decentralized Inheritance smart-contract on the Cardano project catalyst website (a site where people can propose dapps and improvements to get be voted by the community for funding. It is basically a smart contract a person can opt into which will transfer the funds of the wallet to the wallet of who ever they decide and will be triggered if the wallet is 'inactive' for a specified time.

2)Atala Prism project on Cardano which aims to verify identity in a decentralized private way using DIDs. I don't know how it works but apparently you can  verify where this person is who they claim to be without knowing anything about them.

t1_gsnhg1h,"**TL;DR:** Gary Gensler's, potential future head of SEC, views on what a security is and my own attempt to see if XRP fits in the categories he mentions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to discuss the potential Security status of XRP according to the SEC. Early this week, I was going through the MIT Course Blockchain and Money, imparted by Gary Gensler ([who is nominated to lead the SEC](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-gensler-biden-s-pick-to-head-sec-approved-by-senate-committee-11615404521)), in which he talks about the securities and what they are. In [Episode 8](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/session-8-public-policy/) at 1:05:50 he shows The Howey Test, a 4-question test to deem if something is a security, which are the following:

\- Is it an investment of money or an asset?

This one seems to be the easiest to answer: you paid dollars or whatever currency to acquire XRP, so ***yes***.

\- Is it an investment on a common enterprise?

As he points, this one might be more difficult to pin down on open-source software but the involvement of Ripple Labs as developers of XRP would make this one another ***yes***.

\- Is there a reasonable expectation of profits?

He mentions investing with the hopes of an appreciation of the asset in the future, which is the case for most people in crypto. So, ***yes***.

\- Is it reliant on the efforts of others?

He doesn't dwell in this one, but as I understand XRP (as all crypto I would say?) is reliant on adoption of the technology by third parties, which would make this one a ***yes***.

He ends quoting the (by then, September 2018) head of the SEC who reckoned all ICO would fill in these categories and be deemed as securities. He mentions this would be less than 25% of the Crypto market.

Any thoughts about this? Am I missing any points?",ripple,
t1_gsnkt9z,"You’re right, in general, with respect to Genslers analysis. But this was in 2018.

The issue in applying the Howey test is that a digital asset may, at one time, satisfy the test and not at another. This is a fundamental issue that the Court has to deal with.

So whilst it may be arguable that in 2018 it was a security, it is far less arguable that it is today. 

This brings us to the case and the current developments whereby even up to October 2020, the SEC could not advise exchanges whether or not XRP was a security. 

Moreover, it aligns with the comments by the SEC recently that the only sales that they are seeking to preclude are those by Ripple, and not exchanges.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date, since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a lot of people are moving to Binance.

There are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They need to do something else to survive.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

Here there is no easy way of getting PCR test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says ""f\*ck you, save yourself you are in our own"". I'm resting and I hope I didn't infect people close (like my parents :().

I spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen  and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS have helped me a lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon :()

 One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO 

Disclaimer: Even when MOONS are nice and have helped me a lot, I don't  post these updates for that (Moon-farming) I have been doing that for  years a long time ago before MOONS where a thing.

t1_gsnhg1h,"**TL;DR:** Gary Gensler's, potential future head of SEC, views on what a security is and my own attempt to see if XRP fits in the categories he mentions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to discuss the potential Security status of XRP according to the SEC. Early this week, I was going through the MIT Course Blockchain and Money, imparted by Gary Gensler ([who is nominated to lead the SEC](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-gensler-biden-s-pick-to-head-sec-approved-by-senate-committee-11615404521)), in which he talks about the securities and what they are. In [Episode 8](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/session-8-public-policy/) at 1:05:50 he shows The Howey Test, a 4-question test to deem if something is a security, which are the following:

\- Is it an investment of money or an asset?

This one seems to be the easiest to answer: you paid dollars or whatever currency to acquire XRP, so ***yes***.

\- Is it an investment on a common enterprise?

As he points, this one might be more difficult to pin down on open-source software but the involvement of Ripple Labs as developers of XRP would make this one another ***yes***.

\- Is there a reasonable expectation of profits?

He mentions investing with the hopes of an appreciation of the asset in the future, which is the case for most people in crypto. So, ***yes***.

\- Is it reliant on the efforts of others?

He doesn't dwell in this one, but as I understand XRP (as all crypto I would say?) is reliant on adoption of the technology by third parties, which would make this one a ***yes***.

He ends quoting the (by then, September 2018) head of the SEC who reckoned all ICO would fill in these categories and be deemed as securities. He mentions this would be less than 25% of the Crypto market.

Any thoughts about this? Am I missing any points?",xrp,
t1_gsnkt9z,"You’re right, in general, with respect to Genslers analysis. But this was in 2018.

The issue in applying the Howey test is that a digital asset may, at one time, satisfy the test and not at another. This is a fundamental issue that the Court has to deal with.

So whilst it may be arguable that in 2018 it was a security, it is far less arguable that it is today. 

This brings us to the case and the current developments whereby even up to October 2020, the SEC could not advise exchanges whether or not XRP was a security. 

Moreover, it aligns with the comments by the SEC recently that the only sales that they are seeking to preclude are those by Ripple, and not exchanges. 

So I don’t think that Gensler’s comments in 2018 should hold any more value than that it was sound analysis in 2018.",xrp,

The partnerships are real, but yes you can get lost in the xCurrent xVia xRapid shuffle (two of which do not rely on XRP whatsoever).

Yes, partners are incentivized to use XRP, but that's one of the main reasons they have XRP in escrow anyways (to pay themselves a bit and to pay customers to use it).

I was wondering what other coins have a well known risk like that? Personally, I have read about 2 coins in particular, XMR and BNB. 

XMR because of the privacy aspect of it and BNB because the coin is tied to the company profit and that would somehow violate some law. Both reasons invoked seem very weak/unclear to me. I have read about that via random comments this sub so this is by no mean solid info, which is what I'm looking for with this post.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

 One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP

t3_mf0ohx,Best ways to put your BTC into a passive income,btc,
t3_mf0ohx,"This article wants to mainly open a discussion about the best CeFi / DeFi solutions to create value from your BTC bag.

BTC is probably the backbone of many portfolios here, hence is no joke when you choose to stop plain hodling into your cold storage and put your crypto at work producing more crypto: if you decided to get away from the *not your keys, not your coin* golden rule you have to put into serious consideration the benefits and risks. That quote is one of the best pieces of advice, but no dogma.

My personal experience, so far, has been with **BlockFi**, which granted me a 6% APY on BTC (tier1, from 0 to 1 BTC [the rates will change from the 1st of April](https://blockfi.com/our-btc-and-eth-rates-are-changing-and-heres-why)). I chose it for the emphasis on security, for being straightforward: no need to lock or to hold a platform coin, and for the possibility of letting me choose the cryptocurrency in which I could receive interest payments (which allowed me to mainly switch from BTC to ETH payouts when the circumstances were favorable or I wanted to rebalance my portfolio).

But this is not a BlockFi post, on the contrary, as I wrote earlier, Tier2 rates have been changed and heavily penalized. Other interesting possibilities I can find in the CeFi environment are **Nexo** (probably the most interesting, we start at 6% at the base loyalty level, but only if you choose to receive payouts in NEXO tokens, otherwise it's 4%), **Celsius** (5,10% if you choose the payout in CEL, otherwise in-kind reward rate is 4,06% APY - edit: US rates are different and provide a compelling 6,2% till 2 btc and 4,06% after) and **Crypto.com**, which are recently doing some interesting steps forward, between the 70 Billion CRO burned last month and the mainnet launched 3 days ago, aiming to decentralize the coin. In the latter, the APY can vary from 1,5% to 8,5% depending on the locked period and CRO staking.

On the DeFi side, you'll need to first tokenize your BTC, which will have to be converted in an erc-20 token before dedicating yourself to yield farming. wBTC and renBTC are examples of 1:1 BTC pegged tokens.

Some interesting options in the DeFi environment, can be found on **Curve** where, according to Coinmarketcap, the hBTC-wBTC pool grants a 7,62% APY, payout in CRV, with low impermanent loss: Another option is the **Harvest Finance** wBTC vault, with a lofty APY of 17,91%, payout in FARM and CRV, and still low IL, but at the same time a higher risk profile ( it's worth noticing that this DeFi protocol was hacked last October 2020 with 24M stolen).

This is a very fast overview, coming from my personal experience and research, with the risk/reward ratio to be always kept in mind. However, my main goal here is to open a discussion about your experience on BTC yield farming and CeFi/DeFi tools, being the brainstorming coming from this community always helpful. Personally, once I will feel more comfortable with DeFi, I will opt for decentralized protocols, being decentralization the reason why crypto is crypto.

Edit: check also the **Badger.finance**, a decentralized organization/community driven project (DAO), focused on BTC farming, with its BADGER token and two products: Sett (vault, DeFi aggregator with flash loans mitigation measures) and DIGG (non custodial synthetic BTC).

t3_mexb51,DeFi explained: NFTs,btc,
t3_mexb51,"What are NFTs? And what can you do with them? In this post I’ll try to answer these questions.

# What is an NFT?

If you want to understand the concept of NFT, you must first know what a Fungible token is. NFT stands for Non-Fungible token. An important property of a fungible token or “normal” token is that they are interchangeable - You can exchange bitcoins with each other, the value is equally divisible for everyone - bitcoins can be divided into parts and you can exchange them. For example: 0.003240000 BTC.

An important difference with the Fungible tokens is that the NFTs have a unique aspect and cannot be replicated. This unique aspect is encoded in the token's metadata. Think of it as a certificate of authenticity.

## Some features of NFTs:

* They are unique, this allows you to identify items with them.
* They are not divisible.

The latter has the advantage that you can only claim right to a certain product, service or other object such as an art object. Compared to a real-life example; a football ticket for the match is for one person. You cannot share this ticket with multiple people. There is one seat available for you in the grandstand.

## What can you do with NFTs?

The NFTs have already entered the gaming industry. However, there are plenty of applications to come up with in other situations as well. Think of; birth certificate, diploma, or ID. All these unique items can be ""tokenized"". Tokenizen is digitizing a certain asset and linking it to the blockchain, such as art.

## NFTs vs normal tokens

Another difference between normal tokens and NFTs is the protocol they run on. The normal tokens run on the Ethereum protocol: ERC-20.

For Non-fungible tokens there is a choice of two protocols: ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Of which ERC-721 is the most used. ERC-1155 is slightly newer and less used.

The ERC-1155 protocol has been developed to enable developers to implement this protocol in a smart contract in a smart and efficient way. This can then be used to generate unlimited fungible (identical) tokens and non-fungible (unique) tokens.

The ERC-721 protocol, on the other hand, is used to generate non-exchangeable tokens, forcing developers to implement a new smart contract for each new token.

## Non-fungible tokens and gaming: Crypto Kitties

A well-known example using ERC-721 tokens is Crypto Kitties. Each ERC-721 token in that game is a unique digital cat.

You can breed these with the help of another digital cat and create new cats. The new cats can then be bought and sold on the platform.

## Decentraland

Another good example of a platform that utilizes NFT's is Decentraland. The name already gives it away: it is a (virtual) world that is completely ""built"" on blockchain. It can be compared to Simcity: you buy a virtual piece of land, on which you can build and develop whatever you want. Nobody decides what you can build, you are completely free. In addition to buying virtual land, you can also trade other unique assets with other players in the form of NFTs.

## Ethernity chain

Ethernity Chain, a new player to the game, is developing a community-centric platform for digital artists to create limited edition NFT lines. Ethernity Chain enables users to own unique digital artifacts and artwork, which are tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This is of particular appeal to the gaming, music and sports industries. However, the scope for NFTs is unprecedented. Ethernity Chain addresses this with the use of Authenticated non-fungible tokens (ANFTs).

## NFTs in the future: What can you expect from them

One development in which NFTs can play a major role is DeFi. Decentralized Finance. This topic has been growing in popularity in recent years. And the Non-Fungible tokens can play a supporting role in this.

Let's look at an example: a car accident. Two different parties. Two different insurance companies that have to sort everything out among themselves. They need to collect all data. This is a lot easier via the blockchain, because everything is linked. An NFT may contain data about an insurance policy or car. Link smart contracts to this, and you know: you don't have to think about anything yourself. The blockchain will solve it for you.

## Final words

In this post, you’ve learned that non-replaceable tokens are unique and have unique properties. This allows them to be associated with a specific item. In addition, items such as artwork, have different values ​​that make it interesting to use NFTs. Especially in the gaming industry, it is becoming more popular to use NFTs.

And after all BCH is the only coin far and wide working on true financial freedom from the FIAT system. Everyone else is just mad for more FIAT.",btc,
t1_gsmwk2t,"Here's the thing though, the issue isn't that BTC as it is right now acts as a hedge against localized or nationwide recessions. The real concern is whether or not it would hedge against a *global* recession. It is an internationally traded asset so *of course* it will be a decent store of value even if local economies are shutting down - so long as the global economy remains healthy.

OP's point is that there hasn't yet been a lot of tests for BTC's resilience towards global economic crises with the one example we have showing that BTC is in fact not a good store of value in comparison to gold. Granted, it's not enough to make a solid claim about BTC and there is the fact that BTC as it is now may not be the same as it was a year ago, without all this new institutional backing. Nonetheless, it's something we should be wary of rather than blindly believing BTC is a better store of value than gold.",btc,

t1_gsma3oo,"Gold has more adoption and recognition than Btc, that's it. Also, doesn't require any technology for the exchange - that's a big one to be solved yet, imo.

I times of war or disaster, gold can get you what you need, while cash money not always. Go figure stocks. Also, having gold could get you easily killed if you cannot protect yourself. 

When btc will be well established and recognized, then it may save your life in the same way as the gold now.",btc,
t1_gsmi5v1,"&gt;In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.

So the thing is, you're comparing a relatively brand new asset class in bitcoin which is about 10 years old, to a 5,000 year old asset class in gold. There are many reasons why the comparison you're drawing isn't a fair one. For starters, bitcoin is still in its infancy, or price discovery mode, over the course of the next 100 years at minimum. Once we've mined every last bitcoin and only then, would it be fair to draw a comparison to gold as a store of value, in the way you're doing it. 

Basically, people need to calm down with these comparisons and just let bitcoin do it's thing. This is sortof like comparing a high school Michael Jordan to a prime Magic Johnson. Give bitcoin the time it needs before you draw the comparisons.",btc,
t1_gsn4mdk,"Aye, BTC has not seen a sustained economic downturn, yet.

The store of value narrative is still speculative. But there are many of us who are betting on it being one in an economic downturn.

Bitcoin has seen deeper % sell offs vs gold, imo that’s not as important as how quickly price recovers.

If everything falls whatever is falling slowest is likely the textbook definition of a store of value.",btc,
t1_gsmitwl,"That’s ironic since 97% of the users here wish the same so that everyone rejoins the 50k BTC train.

Personally and professionally? If or when it crashes, it prolly wont go bellow 20k. 

But to add to the OP’s general idea, as someone who’s actually studied economics, yeah, I wouldn’t go down that road and treat BTC as a store of value. Just because it mimics gold in certain market aspects, it doesn’t make it into a de facto digital gold. Not denying the potential of that, but we are still veeeery far from achieving such goal.",btc,
t1_gsnbe6d,"I would liken them to restricted shares in a traditional equities market, with an anonymous owner.  No one knows what conditions govern Satoshi's BTC.",btc,

Not that it matters, because no us government would allow another government to control so many satoshis if bitcoin were to become so big in world finance. The us government will crack down on btc, or if they don't, the wallet will awaken later because it was all planned. 

It's so easy to see. This is a major negative of bitcoin, and probably why coins that offer full transparency and accountability should prosper on earth. It'll be interesting to see as time goes on. In the end, being unknown, and having so many coins out there under the control of one group - makes it look like a free ride for someone - especially when the sec wants to go after companies - all of which are more up front that the least of them all - bitcoin.

The paper USD doesn't work because the US has just printed in the last 18 approximately 60% of all money ever created... let that sink in... we've printed more money in the last 18 months than we have in the last 250 years of this country existing. And we are planning another $3.5 TRILLION in printing again. Only thing I hope is that they actually raise the taxes because THAT is better than printing money.

So again, the only HEDGE against inflationary tactics is a decentralized economy not dependent on any one country... ie. Bitcoin, or any other similar currency.

It's also a very interesting investment.

I got into BTC relatively late but I'm still well in profit. I'm holding some BTC. I have to laugh when I hear all the HODL-at-all-costs Sufi circle stuff. Same with the ""Bitcoin will change the world"" crowd. At best, they're just trying to pump bags they've been holding for many years. I owe BTC absolutely nothing. None of us do. I am still trying to make the big money that the early BTC buy-and-hold lot did. THAT is the holy grail - the 10x / 100x / 1000x unknown coin that turns out to have a use case and a massive momentum behind it.

BTC has done very, very well as an investment asset over its history. That doesn't mean it will continue to do so.

I tend to find that if the BTC ""true believers"" are right, then BTC is actually a relatively stable store of value. However, that feels like a trap. Nothing is stable. Not even gold. As we know, the price of BTC is vulnerable to whale activity. Whales can crash BTC easily if they want. As a retail investor I don't like that but I'm willing to go along with it as long as the prospect of big gains are there. In other words, big-time tail risks and unknowns are fine with me, as long as it's VOLATILE. And it's not as volatile as it was, is it.

Comparisons with altcoins show that BTC volatility tends to be a lot less than altcoins. This is despite the fact that BTC gets pumped more than any other crypto. Big money goes towards funding Youtube channels, moderating opinions on Reddit, etc. to pump the price of BTC. And what do we see? The next ATH could be a mere 7% upswing, and the same investment into altcoins could have seen a 40% upswing, as we've seen with Cardano recently. Hmmm...

t3_mf5or1,"Unpopular Opinion. Bitcoin is a hypergrowth tech asset, and not necessarily a traditional recession-proof store of value, and we should be careful with the labels we put to it",btc,
t3_mf5or1,"First of all, before explaining why I believe this, I'll explain what I mean exactly by this.

In this sub, and everywhere in the crypto community, we keep hearing ""Bitcoin is a store of value"", ""Bitcoin is digital gold"" and similar things. According to Investopedia, a store of value is ""an asset that maintains its value, rather than depreciating"", and lists gold as an example. This does not necessarily mean that gold is a better investment than Bitcoin, in fact I believe the opposite, since its inception Bitcoin has been the asset with highest growth.

When we talk about a store of value, we tend to refer to some sort of asset that can provide a decrease in risk to your portfolio during turbulent times. We have very little data that could suggest that Bitcoin is recession-proof or an investment that you should make when your economy is going down, and in fact, most of the little data we have suggests the opposite.

Consider how gold behaved during the 2008 stock market crash. The Dow Jones dropped from 13k in April 28th 2008 to 6.6k in March 2nd 2009, in other words the stock market during that time period almost dropped 50%. In April 2008, gold was at \~1200, and in March 2009 if was at \~1100, with the lowest low reaching \~880 in October 2008, in other words, the price of gold dropped \~27%.

However, Bitcoin wasn't a thing during this time recession, and ever since then we have enjoyed the biggest bull market in American history, leading to all time highs, growth and returns in the tech sector. This was the time when Bitcoin was growing as well.

In fact, the only recession we have had since 2008 was the covid recession, and this is the little data we have about how Bitcoin behaves in a recession:

* Dow Jones dropped from 29.4k in February 10th 2020 to 19.2k in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 35% drop.
* Gold went from 1570 in February 11th 2020 to 1487 in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 6% drop.
* BTC dropped from 10.2k in February 11th 2020 to 5200 in March 17th 2020, a 49% drop.

In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.",btc,

This is the reason why I generally feel bad for those ""two pizzas are now worth X millions"" posts, as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future.

With inflation you can seek refuge by buying assets and having a very limited holding of cash.

Bitcoin needs the legacy financial system to stay in place, otherwise if people adopt BTC there will be a massive collapse in welfare due to economic transactions coming to a halt because people would be incentivized to hoard currency for a future of even more prosperity which will never come because everybody else is also hoarding and not transacting.

If BTC reaches 10-20 trillions, it's time to seek to move to a place which won't be affected by the collapse and get your dose of toilet paper, beans and ammo because bad times are a-coming.

I used memespace.pool to determine the level of priority. It would be great if you share some tips with me, thanks.

Ethereum is so godamn expensive because everyone wants to use it.  Sad people are getting scammed into thinking that BNB is an alternative to projects such as ETH, ADA, DOT, etc, that have actual use cases.

Also, keep in mind there are hundreds of coins that are dirt cheap to transact with (hell Nano is free and it has 1% of BNBs valuation).  It's because, while they are cheap, they have other trade-offs such as scalability, security, or in BNB's case: decentralization.

But primarily between Treasures and Planet, I roughly added it this week and has made about $12 just in my free time or boredom. The Green Karma isn't so much meant to be a profit for the user but a fun way to provide a charity donation, though it does pay little payments and over time, I should be able to cash out my LTC very soon, with ETH following behind it, and BTC after, TRX will add up some day I'm sure lol.

Also, have you tried the bitcoinaliens mobile faucets? They have the BCH and LTC that I have been slacking on recently but super easy and fast little payments that add up and pay automatically every week that you meet the minimum payout, on Tuesdays :)

1. It was used for drugs and illegal items. Therefore it must be anonymous.

2. Its long chains of indecipherable gobbledygook. Its techy and hidden, like the insides of my computer where ""magic happens"" .

t1_gsmmnnu,"A good rule of thumb:

Keep your coins on an exchange if you plan to do regular trading (e.g., ""I'm keeping this coin for a day or few days, then trading it for this other coin""). Good to have the coins readily accessible in this case.

Keep your coins in a wallet if you're plan to hold the coins for longer periods of time (e.g., ""I bought Bitcoin, and I'm not selling or trading it for the next few months or years"").

I should clarify it's not necessarily bad to keep your money on reputable exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). It's safer than it used to be. But because of past events in the cryptocurrency sphere, exchanges are met with a level of skepticism. For example, Mt. Gox was an exchange that suddenly went belly-up in 2014 and customers lost all of their BTC -- approximately 850,000 in total. Some might say it was rather unexpected because they were well established and responsible for over 70% of Bitcoin transactions.

But it's a different time now, and things have come a long way. But there's still concerns over security breaches, and whether or not any given exchange would compensate you should such an event occur. And if an exchange were to close its doors, or go bankrupt, what would that mean for us who have money on it? The stock exchange has much better regulations as far as I'm aware, regulations that may protect us against such things as a brokerage going bankrupt. But for cryptocurrency, it's much less regulated so we're much less protected.

Now, having a private wallet is better in the sense that you have 100% control over it. But there's still security concerns depending on how you go about it. You could go with a hardware ledger (most secure), or an app on your phone or computer (less secure, e.g., what if your phone were secretly infected with a malicious piece of software?) But you could inadvertently be your own worst enemy. For example, losing your private keys to the wallet means your funds are lost forever. If your private keys were stored digitally (never recommended), and a bad actor stole them, then it's game over.

Edit: And also, there's additional fees when sending cryptocurrency back and forth between your wallet and exchanges. So this is another reason why, if day trading specifically, it's more profitable to just keep your coins on the exchange. Plus, the coins are there when you need to trade them -- no delays.",btc,

When btc dropped from 60k to 50k, was it the start of a crash? No, but only because it went back up. Did you sell? No. When would you sell? When you were sure it was a crash? Would that be at 45k? That could well be the bottom, then it goes back up. If you could know it was a crash early enough to sell it would be great, but you can't. 

My opinion on this..

1. Sell some on the way up. Take profits to the point you would be okay if it crashed (in fact, maybe you should be running this equation all the time in crypto). 

2. Hodl, and stop looking at the price, if you believe holders always win. They have so far, eventually fwiw. 

If you go with 1, you feel you messed up by taking profits when everyone said to hodl, if it goes up. It will seem obvious if it does you shouldn't have taken profits.

If you go with 2, you have to weather out the bear market, and it will seem obvious you should have sold. You had it all in your hands and you let it slip.

There are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They need to do something else to survive.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

I spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen  and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS have helped me a lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon :()

 One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

t3_mf7po5,"Bitcoin dominance currently sits at 61%. On January 13, 2018, Bitcoin dominance hit an all time low of 35%.",cash,
t3_mf7po5,"**What is bitcoin dominance?**

[Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) is bitcoin's marketcap dividend by the marketcaps of all cryptocurrencies combined. It shows how much value bitcoin has versus the all cryptos combined. This is important because it shows the relative strength of altcoins over time. For most of bitcoin's lifetime (pre-2017), dominance sat at over 98%. Bitcoin was the entire market. But since the first altcoin boom in 2017, it has never come close to that peak again.

**Why did it happen?**

There are a few reasons why bitcoin value relative to the rest of the crypto market fell so dramatically in 2017. One major reason was the bitcoin cash fork that occurred in July 2017. Bitcoin cash gained momentum throughout late as the ""true"" bitcoin because of miner support while bitcoin was suffering from network congestion and high fees. There were calls that ""the flippening"" was going to occur in early 2018 and there would be a mass exodus of bitcoin supporters moving to bitcoin cash. This never ended up happening and bitcoin cash rapidly fell off after this point. 

Another reason was that other established altcoins at the time like eth, litecoin, dash and monero had huge rallies and hit their all time highs versus bitcoin. While they are similar prices today against the USD, they are still well off their all time highs vs. bitcoin.

The third reason was the first ICO boom. Hundreds of new ICOs hit the market from late 2017 and early 2018. Today we are seeing a similar boom of new ICOs and shitcoins hitting the market.

**What does this mean?**

Bitcoin dominance sitting at 65% means that alt season could run for quite a bit longer. If we see another nosedive of bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance going back below 50% would mean that altcoin values would have gained hundreds of billions in value. While the altcoin market has absolutely surged over 2021, its still far from its all time highs in early 2018. I think the altcoin market will continue to boom.",cash,

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues


Next session: Public Policy",cash,
t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it. One guy cant decide that an update is happening. The miners must accept it.",cash,

t1_gsnczpy,"The problem is getting people aware of the spots. You can set up all the spots you want but if people don’t know about them or if they don’t have smart phones it doesn’t matter. People who find out about WeNano aren’t going to tell others because they’ll want to keep it to themselves. Also, anyone who does get crypto through these channels in Venezuela is likely going to immediately cash out to fiat. Not that there’s anything wrong with that—you just have to be aware you’re essentially donating fiat support with crypto as an intermediary, not helping to build a crypto economy as you might hope.

Additionally, there are people gaming WeNano in Venezuela. I set up a spot that only paid out once per person. I was excited because the spot had 460 payouts, and I thought this is great: 460 unique individuals getting Nano. Then I started digging on the block explorer and found that all of the accounts were funneling to a single address that wasn’t an exchange before sending to an exchange. So basically one person set up hundreds of accounts somehow and got 46 Nano from me. There were some posts about this in the Nano sub and some other community members found the same thing to be the case for their spots in Venezuela.

If you believed the current btc value was wrong you could just buy bitcoin with that cash value after spending it.

To put it another way, its an illusion to think the pizza guy made a mistake. Because the exchange was available back then, anyone who paid for pizza in cash made the same error, as they could have spent that cash on bitcoin.

The presence of an exchange rate literally makes that much fiat worth that much bitcoin, so they are identical for payment use.

t1_gsm26od,"Take a longer term view.  Make a plan and stick to your plan.  Don't be reactive to the day to day events.  Expect volatility and understand that it can lead you psychologically to make the wrong decisions (e.g., panic selling on dips, panic buying at sharp rises).  Remember that the most successful crypto investors are the dead ones.   Reacting daily, particularly when you're new, is probably a losing strategy.  When you're making a purchase, you should have an idea of if and when you would take profits and how much.  You should also have an idea what you would do if it falls.

Understand and think about your risk tolerance and tailor your plan around it.  Yes, a tiny market cap coin nobody ever heard of has a better chance of going 100x in a single day than the largest market cap coins, but it also has a better chance of dropping to nothing in a day.  Don't put money in that you cannot afford to lose.  Research the coins you're buying.  Trust your (researched) judgment over people you find on the internet.  Understand that when you're hearing a ""crypto celebrity"" on the internet tell you to buy a coin, it's entirely possible it's so they can dump it.

Don't believe anybody who claims they can make precise price predictions over the short term.  Instead, consider dollar cost averaging (DCA).  Take your time and make decisions that you can stand behind.  Don't feel that you need to race into this or you'll miss out (FOMO).

Research and take appropriate security precautions for how you store your crypto.  If you're getting into substantial amounts, don't leave your crypto on an exchange indefinitely.  Make sure you using multi-factored authentication for services you're using that provide it.  Use strong passwords and don't use the same password for different services.  Consider the use of a cold wallet.  Also make a plan for what happens with your crypto if something happens to you.    If someone messages you directly from reddit, there's a good chance it's because they want to try to scam you.  If you're using a hot wallet, be aware there are ""fake"" versions of them sometimes on the app stores.  Make sure you're downloading the official version.  When you're transferring crypto, do it very carefully--i.e., be careful not to transfer from a wallet with one type of coin to a wallet with another type of coin (e.g., from bitcoin to bitcoin cash).  Consider using ""allow-listing"" when using exchanges: i.e., set up the wallets you'd be moving crypto to and restricting transactions to those.  If you are using allow-listing, consider moving a smaller transaction before moving a large amount (yes, you'll lose a little to fees with that method, but it's better than losing your whole stack).  Be careful talking about crypto with friends and family.  Consider the merits of, just, not telling people.

Finally, participate in the /r/cryptocurrency (as you already are).  It's a good time. ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)",cash,

t1_gsn55dl,"The reason I got myself a hardware wallet is that I was caught up in a Coinbase outage a couple of months ago. It was scary stuff. Balance went to zero, crypto went to [""transfers@coinbase.com](mailto:""transfers@coinbase.com)"". I'm not gonna lie I was pretty terrified. I had left too much sitting there on Coinbase.

Anyway, it all worked out in the end and my crypto and cash were restored. To prevent this from ever happening again in the future, I bought a Trezor.

Something that people don't often mention is how a hardware wallet becomes a psychological reason to HODL. I will probably always keep some BTC no matter the price, just because of the cool factor and feeling of total control a hardware wallet gives you.",cash,

t1_gsmu2e2,"Nobody is ever scared about deflation but it's even worse.

With inflation you can seek refuge by buying assets and having a very limited holding of cash.

With deflation there is no way to escape the economic collapse which happens when people don't spend and hoard money as they could eat banknotes

It's a really dire situation nobody ever talks about . Bitcoin needs the legacy financial system to stay in place, otherwise if people adopt BTC there will be a massive collapse in welfare due to economic transactions coming to a halt because people would be incentivized to hoard currency for a future of even more prosperity which will never come because everybody else is also hoarding and not transacting.

If BTC reaches 10-20 trillions, it's time to seek to move to a place which won't be affected by the collapse and get your dose of toilet paper, beans and ammo because bad times are a-coming.

Alternatively just start spending like mad and get a load of quality of life so when shit hits the fan, at least you'd have the memories of good times, and I mean real good times, not just numbers on a screen signaling an increase in paper wealth",cash,

I used memespace.pool to determine the level of priority. It would be great if you share some tips with me, thanks. In fact, many advocates Bitcoin Cash (BCH) criticized BTC due to the ridiculous fees. In other words, BTC = Gold and BCH = peer-to-peer cash.

But primarily between Treasures and Planet, I roughly added it this week and has made about $12 just in my free time or boredom. The Green Karma isn't so much meant to be a profit for the user but a fun way to provide a charity donation, though it does pay little payments and over time, I should be able to cash out my LTC very soon, with ETH following behind it, and BTC after, TRX will add up some day I'm sure lol.

Also, have you tried the bitcoinaliens mobile faucets? They have the BCH and LTC that I have been slacking on recently but super easy and fast little payments that add up and pay automatically every week that you meet the minimum payout, on Tuesdays :)

So, I thought I'd never see that money again, but I did see it again, and saw even more because I didn't cash out, just converted to BTC, which I held until March the following year, not the best choice, because it would be worth about $100k right now...but you get the idea.

2) They  are digitally printed so they can be as easily digitally destroyed if there's overheating

I don't mean this to defend the Fed or Treasury or Macroeconomists, but I anticipate that those entities will start to communicate with the public much more frequently and heavily what they are doing. 

So pretty soon the 75% figure in this survey might be much lower provided that the institutions above communicate what they are doing in an effective manner (ie. they should hire Ray Dalio).

Those who sold when the dip started and bought in around 52k (not even the lowest point) will have made another 13% by the time it hits that level again.  The more waves between those peaks, the more there is to be earned. 

2) Cash out

t3_mey1y7,"This will be a boiled down argument for why you should stop checking your portfolio hourly, daily and even weekly - and what intense portfolio-looking does to you.

1. The biggest and easiest to explain factor is glaringly obvious when explained and it comes down to statistics. If you expect 100% gains during a 1 year investment, it will not go up all the time during those 525.600 minutes of the year. At best, it will be up from the last minute, maybe 10.000 times more than it will be down. Say you check bitcoins price every minute 51/100 times it will be up (this is even generous). This is important, because og the theory in psychology that states losses cause more hurt than gains reward in terms of happiness.

But if you check daily instead of per minute, you might be up 200/365 days. That’s significantly up from 51/100. Now if you check monthly, you might be up 8/12 og 9/12 months (from the last month) assuming a 100% expected yearly return. (This is a high apy, but still applies to a low one, but let’s be real, if ur in bitcoin you expect high returnand volatility)

If you are a holder believing in bitcoin, you’re better off checking as few times as possible since variances in prices on daily candles are insignificant compared to the long term, and what you are seeing is the outcome of randomness. When you factor in the psychology of loss and gain, your mental will lose every time when checking often. By checking the price monthly or twice monthly, what you see is bitcoins actual price movement and not the result of daytraders random results.

2. Becoming too invested in your investment. Dedicating your time to checking your portfolio also takes time away from other productive things (or even just watching tv). If you’re not planning on changing your investment, there’s no reason to be checking it often since no matter how many times you do so, it’s still going to be the same price in 1 month as if you didn’t check. Spend that time watching tv instead, it’s better than wasting time watching random outswings in price.

3. Being down from your ATH is frustrating. 
By checking bitcoins price often, you make sure you will be seeing the price being DOWN from the ATH 99% of the time. If you check it less, chances are you still won’t be seeing the ATH.. but instead of being 15% down from ATH you shift your focus to being up 10% since you checked last month.
This third reason could vary from person to person with it being insignificant to some people.


TL;DR:
By checking your portfolio often, you’re just checking the results of daytraders random outcome. Checking less often gives you a clearer indication of bitcoins actual price moment. 

Psychological principles say losses hurt more than wins gain - leaving your unconscious mood to be decided by daytraders is probably not in your interests when investing in bitcoin. 

Check less often for higher chance of being up from when you last checked to be affected less by random, insignificant price actions. This applies if you’re a bitcoin bull in a bull market.",long,
t3_mfdfiw,Analyze: When the bull market ends? 4 indicators.,long,
t3_mfdfiw,"  

**Short answer: Nobody knows! This is not financial advice.**

Long answer: Nobody knows, but there are some indications. Still not financial advice.

**1 / Market cycle duration**

First bitcoin cycle was around 15 months. Second one was 36 months. Third one was 48 months. So, you could conclude as market cap grows, each cycle becomes slower at accumulating more capital. So far, this cycle has been 26 months from the bottom. If the trend is going to continue, this cycle still has a lot to offer.

**2 / Market cap peak trendline**

If we draw the trendlines from previous cycles ([chart by Peter Brandt CEO of Factor LLC](https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-11.20.35-AM-775x446.png?format=webp)), it seems that we still have room before reaching the peak area. This trendline is based on very few data points, but if the market is going to behave the same way, it appears that we are in in the middle of the current cycle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbfijdSZAU) for more info. 

**3 / Ratio between long-term holders to short-term holders.**

In simple terms, in the last bull-markets short-term holders increased and long-term holders decreased to certain levels when we approached the end of market cycle. [In this chart](https://i.imgur.com/eGEwsHQ.png) you can see this ratio (and the [mathematics behind it](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/rhodl-ratio/)), going to red area indicates that we are near the end of cycle.

**4 / Stock to flow model**

For 'store of value' commodities there has been a useful model which has predicted the value of assets like gold and silver. Since bitcoin behaves similarly, it has been successful at predicting bitcoin too. Each time the real price deviated from the model; it went back to it. Right know we are very close to [the model’s prediction](https://i.imgur.com/Lpe3Kbz.png), which could indicate a rather “fair value”.

In the end, it has been always said “[all models are wrong, some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)”. Market is unpredictable, there is a big chance non of this happens. But if we are to guess, this bull market doesn't seem to be finished yet.",long,

t3_mfebl8,"Bidders say they had many different motivations, including fun, self-promotion and a signal of support for the NFT market.

https://preview.redd.it/gtfwdp3z8vp61.png?width=426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a985867329521a2c068e82a0dc49ee7e77d82528

I’ve had some strange experiences in my career as a journalist. But nothing even remotely prepared me for the experience of watching total strangers competing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a picture of my words.

A few weeks ago, I decided to write a column about the rise of nonfungible tokens, the hottest craze in the cryptocurrency world, with a meta twist: I would [turn the column itself into a NFT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html) and put it up for auction, with the proceeds going to The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund.

When I pitched the idea to my bosses, I thought the stunt might attract a handful of bids from curious Times readers who had spare Ethereum, the cryptocurrency being used for the auction, burning a hole in their digital wallets. Maybe we’d raise a few hundred dollars for charity and explain the complicated process of creating and selling NFTs along the way. I set the auction’s minimum price low — 0.5 Ether, or about $800 — and was nervous I might not get even that much.

Instead, the auction became a circus. I listed it on Wednesday morning, and before I went to bed that night, the top bid had risen to more than $30,000. When I woke up the next morning, it was $43,000. In the final hour of the auction, I watched, slack-jawed, as a last-minute bidding war broke out.

$98,000.

$143,000.

$277,000.

After more than 30 bids, the auction ended at 12:32 p.m. Eastern time, with a [winning bid](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129) of 350 Ether, or about $560,000. A few minutes later, after the auction platform had taken its cut, nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrency landed in my digital wallet. I was stunned. Congratulatory texts and media requests started pouring in. My colleagues joked about stiffing the charity and slipping off to the Cayman Islands. My editor said I shouldn’t expect a raise.

The whole ordeal was surreal, and it raised the question: Why would anyone spend the price of a high-end Lamborghini on a picture of my words? After all, the NFT was just a cryptographic signature linked to an image of a column that anyone could read on The Times’s website, albeit with a few bonus perks. (I also stipulated that I would feature the winner’s name and photo in a follow-up column, and Michael Barbaro, the host of “The Daily,” gamely agreed to throw in a voice message for the winner.)

The winner, whose [handle on the auction site was @3fmusic](https://foundation.app/3FMusic), appeared to be a prominent NFT collector. The profile on the site was linked to a Twitter profile belonging to a Dubai-based music production company, and to an Instagram account identified as that of Farzin Fardin Fard, the company’s chief executive. The user’s NFT collection included a variety of other expensive digital works, including a $14,000 “emoji portrait” of the musician Billie Eilish and a $8,000 piece titled “Jumping Spider enjoying coffee in the morning.”

I reached out to u/3fmusic to offer my congratulations on the purchase and to discuss the bid. They (it’s not clear if the winner is Mr. Fard or some other individual or multiple people) declined to be named — and, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain-based transactions, there’s no easy way for me to identify them beyond the information they volunteered — but they sent me a statement over Twitter direct message that read:

“We are already involved in art and media for a long time now,” the message read. “Our management team is always in cooperation with some highly knowledgeable and experienced art advisers who believe that we must grow with technological movements that help us to not only promote our business but also to support artists and the art market. Thus, we have proudly decided to dedicate sufficient funds and resources to invest in NFT as pioneers of this industry.”

They also gave me permission to include an image of their music studio’s logo in this column.

Jiannan Ouyang, an NFT collector who dropped out of the auction after a high bid of 290 Ether (about $469,000), told me that he had decided to bid on my NFT for both personal and professional reasons. He’s a former Facebook research scientist who is now a blockchain entrepreneur, and he’s married to a journalist.

“This column reflects the thoughts we exchange daily about how the NFT technology will reshape the modern media and advertising industry,” he told me.

Some NFT collectors believe that owning early, prominent crypto-tokens will eventually be like owning rare, first-edition books or priceless paintings. Mr. Ouyang admitted that the value of my NFT was “still highly speculative and subjective.” But he said he believed that NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies would ultimately reshape the entire media landscape, allowing creators to reimagine how they create and monetize their works.

“This particular NFT from The New York Times is one of the answers and will become a historical landmark in this inevitable movement,” he said. “That’s why I think it is valuable.”

Rulton Fyder, a pseudonymous NFT artist who declined to be named, topped out at a bid of 21 ether (about $34,000). He echoed Mr. Ouyang’s thoughts that my NFT might someday have historical significance, and said that beyond the stunts, NFTs were creating a “new digital value system” that was worth taking seriously.

“People from my generation who grow up in the 1970s will love to collect first edition books, novels such as Ulysses by James Joyce,” he wrote in an email. “What crypto and NFT opened up is the ownership of the rights to say one owns such a thing, whether tangible or intangible, in a form that thousands if not millions can see and track the ownership in real time, anywhere in the world.”

André Allen Anjos, an electronic musician from Portland, Ore., who bid 5.69 Ether (about $9,200) on the NFT, told me in a phone interview that bidding on the token could be seen as a symbolic gesture of thanks from the crypto community to me and The Times for, essentially, taking them seriously enough to experiment with our own token sale.

“It’s like, here’s a mainstream publication trying to interact with us as a community in an earnest and real way,” he said. “I wanted to signal, ‘Hey, this is cool, you’re asking the right questions.’”

Mr. Anjos said he had grown up in the era of Napster, when musicians first realized that the internet could destroy their livelihoods by making it free and easy to duplicate songs. Blockchain technology, he said, had changed that by making it possible to create limited-edition collectibles stamped with a digital marker of their provenance.

Collecting NFTs, Mr. Anjos said, was less about owning the pieces themselves — most of which can be freely downloaded from the internet, albeit without their special cryptographic signatures — and more about signaling belief in this new model of ownership.

“I’m not going to call it a protest, but it’s a statement,” he said. “This is the crypto world trying to prove that we’re here, we care about revolutionizing this entire model, and we’re willing to put our money on it.”

“My thinking was: Maybe a photoshop of my face, or some type of super pro-Bitcoin ‘you stuck it to The New York Times’ thing,” he said.

Bidding on NFTs, he said, had become a kind of sport among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, many of whom have been sitting on huge virtual piles of Ethereum and Bitcoin for years. Every NFT auction produces a public record of bids, and high-profile auctions can attract a crowd of people just hoping to be noticed among the losers.

“The bid itself is becoming marketing,” he said.

But Mr. Agrawal clarified that some bids were less strategic, and more about showing off.

“A lot of the NFT buyers at this high level are fabulously wealthy, and they’re just collecting for the sake of collecting,” he said.

In addition to readers who eagerly followed along with the NFT auction, I did got some questions from people who worried about the environmental impact of promoting NFTs that use the Ethereum blockchain. (The Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, requires vast computational power, and [critics have called it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) an emerging environmental hazard.) I fully support developing less computationally intensive ways to do blockchain transactions, and to mitigate any harmful effects of this experiment, I’m personally buying $400 in carbon offset credits — enough to offset about 100 times as many carbon emissions as I generated by auctioning off this NFT.

And as soon as I can figure out how to do the transaction without completely screwing up my taxes, I’ll be sending roughly 300 Ether — worth about $497,000, at the current market price — [to the Neediest Cases Fund](https://www.nytimes.com/column/neediest-cases).

t3_mewytg,Why $8 Billionaire Soros is Investing in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Suddenly [A Short Article],long,
t3_mewytg," 

Opinions on cryptocurrencies are very far apart as of right now. It seems there are fewer people who consider this industry to be a bubble. George Soros is a notorious example in this regard. Earlier this year, he claims Bitcoin is a bubble. It seems that comment helped push the price down, which may have been the plan all along.

## The Curious Case of George Soros

Few people were surprised when [George Soros](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/06/george-soros-makes-spectacular-u-turn-cryptocurrency/) claimed Bitcoin is a bubble. In January of 2018, he described cryptocurrrency as a bubble and a misnomer. Moreover, Bitcoin can’t be labeled as a currency because it’s not a stable store of value. All of these comments hold some sort of truth, but they are not entirely factual either.

The volatility associated with Bitcoin has been well-documented in the past. It seems the year 2018 brings us more of the same,. During the first few months, we have seen a lot of bearish [Bitcoin price](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/08/bitcoin-price-weekly-analysis-btc-usds-upsides-remain-capped/) pressure. George Soros considers this to be one of the biggest drawbacks about Bitcoin. Even so, it is possible his comments are designed to purposefully drive the price down altogether. Wall Street players did not take kindly to the Bitcoin price hitting $19,000 late last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether or not the comments by George Soros attributed to the price decline, is always a big question. It is evident Soros is often considered to be a guru became of his “strategic calls based on macroeconomic conditions”. Even so, claiming Bitcoin is a bubble is perhaps the worst assessment of his career. In fact, it seems he did a complete 180-degree turn on cryptocurrencies altogether.

## The Cryptocurrency Investment Decision

Now that the Bitcoin price has dipped quite a bit, George Soros prepares to invest in cryptocurrency. This rather odd decision only fuels speculation involving price manipulation. Even though George Soros still considers digital currencies to be not “actual currencies”, the volatility has suddenly turned him into a believer. Such a sudden change of heart is often part of a bigger agenda.

For the time being, it seems Soros is quite happy with the way things are going for Bitcoin. With the big dip in place, it seems things may improve from here on out. He is not the first [Wall Street ](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/04/coinbase-adds-another-wall-street-exec-scales-institutional-markets/)mogul to invest in cryptocurrencies either. Alan Howard and the Rothschild family are taking very similar steps in this regard. It seems the interest in cryptocurrency is only growing, even among financial experts.

The big question is whether or not cryptocurrency prices can rebound. Right now, it seems the situation is still brittle, as things can change pretty quickly. Even so, the bearish pressure has been prevalent for a very long time. Sooner or later, things will need to improve again. Bitcoin’s price may very well return to the five-digit range in the future. How long that process will take, is anybody’s guess at this point.

t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”. 

Vitalik got what he wanted with Ethereum and Charles got what he wanted with Cardano. The good vs. evil battle that you are making this out to be is an exaggeration that comes from you “picking a side”.",long,

Granted, it's not enough to make a solid claim about BTC and there is the fact that BTC as it is now may not be the same as it was a year ago, without all this new institutional backing.

All blocks will be produced by independent stake pools after the current Epoch ends.  With roughly 70% of all ADA in circulation staked, this will make Cardano a very decentralized ecosystem.  There’s also over 2000 stake pools now all over the world.  I’m located in the US, but I actually delegate to pools in Ireland, England, and the US through 3 different wallets.

The price of this event should be baked in to the current price of ADA.  Long time holders have been watching the progress bar towards total block production by the Cardano Community.

Now my opinion...

The Cardano Community is invested into Cardano just like the Ethereum Community is invested into Ethereum.  There’s also many people invested in both.  I see a scenario where both are successful.  If this happens, all of crypto benefits.  The scenarios where one or both fail are actually very bad for the alt coin space as a whole.  The constant bashing of both projects only degrades cryptos as an investment.  You don’t see the suits on Wall Street constantly bashing competitors.

t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",long,

I got into BTC relatively late but I'm still well in profit. I'm holding some BTC. I have to laugh when I hear all the HODL-at-all-costs Sufi circle stuff. Same with the ""Bitcoin will change the world"" crowd. At best, they're just trying to pump bags they've been holding for many years. I owe BTC absolutely nothing. None of us do. I am still trying to make the big money that the early BTC buy-and-hold lot did. THAT is the holy grail - the 10x / 100x / 1000x unknown coin that turns out to have a use case and a massive momentum behind it.

BTC has done very, very well as an investment asset over its history. That doesn't mean it will continue to do so.

I tend to find that if the BTC ""true believers"" are right, then BTC is actually a relatively stable store of value. However, that feels like a trap. Nothing is stable. Not even gold. As we know, the price of BTC is vulnerable to whale activity. Whales can crash BTC easily if they want. As a retail investor I don't like that but I'm willing to go along with it as long as the prospect of big gains are there. In other words, big-time tail risks and unknowns are fine with me, as long as it's VOLATILE. And it's not as volatile as it was, is it.

Comparisons with altcoins show that BTC volatility tends to be a lot less than altcoins. This is despite the fact that BTC gets pumped more than any other crypto. Big money goes towards funding Youtube channels, moderating opinions on Reddit, etc. to pump the price of BTC. And what do we see? The next ATH could be a mere 7% upswing, and the same investment into altcoins could have seen a 40% upswing, as we've seen with Cardano recently. Hmmm...

I do like to help others as well as myself to get BTC in perspective.",long,
t1_gsn1bn9,"My avg price per XRP is $0.22, I'm up +120%, and that's not even all that great considering not too long ago it was trading for $0.16.

I still like the project. I've held XRP since 2018. I disagree with the current ownership of half of the supply, but it is an excellent crypto in terms of usability and decentralized operation. There are no legitimate claims otherwise, as anything you read to the contrary are subjective and fueled with emotion vs approaching this objectively.

Usually the argument goes like this:

😡😡😡 **XRP sHiTcOiN** 😡😡😡

*Please elaborate?*

**Founders and Ripple own it. Pre-mined.** 😤

*Satoshi and Vitalik both had enough of their own coins to have $49b and $600m, respectively. Ripple owns $28b in XRP at today's price to put it in perspective.*

Then the convo usually ends with the tribalistic XRP hater ignoring facts by stating the same shit over and over without evidence or just stops responding.",long,
t1_gsnfapt,"Most people can’t see the bigger picture of how useful XRP is and how useful ETH is also, BTC is just going to be a store of value and replace gold in the long run.",long,
t3_mf0iff,"""If I had bought BTC in the early 2010's at 10 cents, I would be a millionaire now"". Truth is: You would have sold long before BTC reached even its 2017 ATH of 20k USD.",long,
t3_mf0iff,"Seeing things in hindsight makes you feel dumb, but the real truth is that back then nobody saw it coming. Only few, very few people really believed in BTC as a store of value or whatever. If you could go back in time and told people in 2010 that in 2021 hedge funds, S&amp;P500 companies and even insurance companies are buying billions worth of BTC at 40k+ USD and using it as a store of value, everybody would just see you as the tin-foil hat person, laugh at you and call you mad and delusional.

This is the reason why I generally feel bad for those ""two pizzas are now worth X millions"" posts, as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future. As such, the moment your holdings were at 10x your initial investment, very, very likely you would have sold as well, or just bought that awesome thing you could suddenly acquire with magic internet money.

That being said, do not punish yourself with the ""if I had"" thinking. Invest what you can and hold while you can. Taking profits is not a bad idea as well.",long,
t1_gslzplh,"I agree, I don't anticipate btc dominance falling below 50% until a true contender shows up. I don't see any coins out there with enough institutional support to do that. But altcoins will continue to run up as long as the bitcoin bull run is alive and well.",long,
t1_gsmibw5,"Thank you! That is my main gripe with the 'store of value' line of thought. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a store of value are: fungibility, hedge against inflation, and low volatility. BTC has absolutely insane volatility. Even if it went up monotonically from here, which it won't, it wouldn't be a store of value because it would have high volatility in the positive direction. Gold fulfills all these requirements because of its history as a reserve currency and its consistent demand. BTC will never have the consistent demand that gold has, and does not have the institutional backing over centuries. Is it a fantastic investment long term? Yes. But only if you're cool with 50-60% drawdown over 2-4 year cycles.",long,
t1_gsm6na6,"I find this bull run pretty simular with the 2017-2018, just this time less institutional investors talk bad about btc. But its not only btc the stocks are actually in a bubble as well.

t1_gsmfq39,"I think people don't understand the implications of the btc blockchain being public. They think there is something naturally anonymising about bitcoin because

1. It was used for drugs and illegal items. Therefore it must be anonymous.

2. Its long chains of indecipherable gobbledygook. Its techy and hidden, like the insides of my computer where ""magic happens"" .

So I think monero is undervalued because there is mistaken privacy effectively priced into bitcoin (and expectations of future use and privacy). At some point the penny will drop. 

It's not a pressing issue tho, since nobody actually uses bitcoin for anything other than wealth storage.",long,
t1_gskdegt,"I really see your point. If you look at the long term chart of btc with halvings marked, you see the movements are very similar.",long,
t1_gsmmnnu,"A good rule of thumb:

Keep your coins on an exchange if you plan to do regular trading (e.g., ""I'm keeping this coin for a day or few days, then trading it for this other coin""). Good to have the coins readily accessible in this case.

Keep your coins in a wallet if you're plan to hold the coins for longer periods of time (e.g., ""I bought Bitcoin, and I'm not selling or trading it for the next few months or years"").

I should clarify it's not necessarily bad to keep your money on reputable exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). It's safer than it used to be. But because of past events in the cryptocurrency sphere, exchanges are met with a level of skepticism. For example, Mt. Gox was an exchange that suddenly went belly-up in 2014 and customers lost all of their BTC -- approximately 850,000 in total. Some might say it was rather unexpected because they were well established and responsible for over 70% of Bitcoin transactions.

But it's a different time now, and things have come a long way. But there's still concerns over security breaches, and whether or not any given exchange would compensate you should such an event occur. And if an exchange were to close its doors, or go bankrupt, what would that mean for us who have money on it? The stock exchange has much better regulations as far as I'm aware, regulations that may protect us against such things as a brokerage going bankrupt. But for cryptocurrency, it's much less regulated so we're much less protected.

Now, having a private wallet is better in the sense that you have 100% control over it. But there's still security concerns depending on how you go about it. You could go with a hardware ledger (most secure), or an app on your phone or computer (less secure, e.g., what if your phone were secretly infected with a malicious piece of software?) But you could inadvertently be your own worst enemy. For example, losing your private keys to the wallet means your funds are lost forever. If your private keys were stored digitally (never recommended), and a bad actor stole them, then it's game over.

Edit: And also, there's additional fees when sending cryptocurrency back and forth between your wallet and exchanges. So this is another reason why, if day trading specifically, it's more profitable to just keep your coins on the exchange. Plus, the coins are there when you need to trade them -- no delays.",long,
t1_gsmrid0,"Check out Twitter. There are a few guys that are consistent with their picks, link to TA or research, update with new updates, etc. Still up to your own research. Icodrops is a great resource of upcoming icos that you may want to invest in, but again dyor. I would also suggest checking out the macro level changes in the space and diversify your investments accordingly. Have long term plays in areas that you think will have growth, DeFi, NFTs, storage, energy, oracles, whatever. Overall just make sure you’re compare your gains to BTC growth, bc if you can’t beat the growth of btc, might as well just take the most stable asset in the space.",long,

t3_mf44b2,"For those who are unclear on big things happening soon in the Ethereum ecosystem, here is a handy timeline!",long,
t3_mf44b2,"So, every week I update a post in r/ethfinance which shows the big things upcoming in the ETHosphere. Posting here as hopefully some of you will get a kick out of it too. If you are unsure as to exactly when the long planned Eth2 or scaling upgrades are happening, this post is for you.

In the other sub I will post a bunch of context on what has changed this week, but here I'll just present the timeline. Links provided if you want to dig deeper on each project. I realise that it assumes a ton of prior-knowledge about Ethereum jargon, so to intro this, basically there are two big threads happening in Ethereum right now...

Firstly, the impending Eth1 / Eth 2 upgrades. These are codenamed Berlin (April), Altair (June), London (July) and Shanghai (late 2021). For those with a little Eth knowledge, the highly anticipated upgrades will be London, which delivers the fee burning, issuance reducing EIP-1559, and Shanghai, which should deliver the Eth1/Eth2 merge, at which point Ethereum fully adopts Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus layer. Keep in mind PoS is already live since December, but it isn't until the merge that proof of work is replaced by PoS.

Secondly, scaling. Everybody knows that fees on Ethereum are absolutely horrendous right now. In some ways this is a good problem to have as it demonstrates how immensely valuable and used Ethereum is, even at this stage of its development, but that's not to say it doesn't need to be resolved. Ethereum has chosen to take an approach where it scales initially (this year) using rollups technology (of several varieties, as you can see below), to be followed next year by sharding. Launches of rollups solutions are highly anticipated, as are dapp upgrades that implement these rollup solutions (eg Uniswap).

A big thing to note is that this list is by no means comprehensive. There are waaaay too many awesome projects being delivered every week in Ethereum, I've just tried to pick out the most notable.

Hopefully that makes sense and some find this useful.

And you may not like what they have to say. You better read their user agreement (which is like a hundred of pages long) and have some sort of law degree before you decide to send them your coins. As Coinbase say: 

"" We may, in our sole discretion ... suspend or terminate any Coinbase Account or the trading of specific Digital Currency in your account. ""

Just google ""coinbase account locked/suspended"".  While you're at it also try googling ""coinbase account hacked"" in order to also consider the risk of your account getting hacked due to phishing and that sort of stuff.

After all the considerations it doesn't seem so terrible of an idea to actually keep your crypto yourself.

I agree with your point though: keep your funds where you think they’ll be the safest.  For some people who are forgetful (or have small kids), this might well be on an exchange.  Just make sure to take into account all sources of risk when making this choice.

t1_gslwy79,"Institutional investment (huge amounts, long positions, by entities that do not have to sell) will keep supply scarce to meet demand when price falls abruptly, easily driving the price up again.

This deflationary effect of major hoarding adds to the disinflationary model of Bitcoin.

As bad as it gets (20k?), there will be more people wanting in than people wanting out.",long,
t1_gsnmw1z,Definitely what I think. Gold doesn't spike up thousands of dollars and fall back down within a week. It's a very safe bet and very safe investment for long term as well as short term. We have all seen crypto rising and falling for pointless reasons like memes. It's a very high risk very high reward investment which most people are not recommended to invest in today's scenario.,long,
t1_gsn15to,"I’m actually new to crypto and Reddit. My account is a year old but just started using it. I’ve been investing in gold and silver for a long time because my father did.

t1_gsmg2lq,It’s just a disinflationary asset that you can Trust will stay true to form.  That means over the long run it will go up significantly given more adoption.

t1_gsmy2hg,"I would probably disagree with alot of this.  This is no different than Elon Musk not only not selling any of his Tesla shares, but even buying more throughout this rise.  It's almost certain that currently, Tesla is well beyond fair valuation, but price typically reflects a lot on future value.  

The guy wouldn't invent this and then magically think ""Nah.  Not worth"". Then jump ship. He knew the value long before anyone and knows its value better than anyone on this site.  

He probably won't sell until his vision has come to fruition.  I guarantee the current state of bitcoin is not his vision.  Bitcoin went from basically a scam, to money for criminals, to a meme tipping service, and is currently more at the ""Store of value"" stage with it only beginning to be recognized as legitimate.

I would bet the value of Bitcoins price has absolutely no reflection on this mans decision to sell or not.  I would argue that until this mans vision is fulfilled to fruition, he will not sell anything more than something he might used to live on if needed.  

That being said, I have no idea.  Maybe a meme tipping service was enough for him and he sold around 20k causing the crash.  I have no idea honestly.",long,

t1_gskpl3m,Yeah man let me tell you about friends who pay you back what they owe you. For me alot of the time is was a show of respect. I paid for a lot of my friends for a long time because I just had more than they had so I would usually go out and buy drinks and stuff for everybody.but it was never forgotten when somebody would hit me back with like all thanks for buying the drinks or they got another round.

I’m glad I wasn’t invested during the crash although it would’ve been fun making money on the climb in 2017 before it all collapsed. Looks like it’s bouncing back quite well though and I feel hopeful for cryptos future! 

I’m very curious about mining lately. My buddy and I are somewhat talking about building a rig together and letting it mine ETH for us as we are both long term bullish on the coin. Any particular things I should look into before mining ETH specifically? Maybe I should wait until 2.0 and things become more energy efficient? I’d really like to mine a coin that I could also stake with in order to compound my “interest” and get a nice stockpile going.",long,
t1_gsnokeh,Long past time for Eth to break out,long,
t1_gsnnop5,"I'm on this too. Planing at least.

I'm under impression that simple holding will not do in long run. There are many people who bought early and are happy with the gains, but that will be happening less often as cryptocurrency in general is more widely known.

We have to stand out of the crowd to become rich. Maybe not today, but soon. Starting an exchange is already very hard to do and there is plenty of people doing that.

I'm betting on validation/running nodes as a service to community that i hope I will be rewarded nicely.

I might have to invest big time, but in the end of the day that's what my gains are for,aren't they?

If you hold so many you're likely  a believer in the long term price, and also if you have enough money to straight up purchase a house without any mortgage you're not going to buy an old house worth $870k, you'll go for something more expensive",long,

I optimized it to be as robust as it can be but ofc it's never that easy. But it's made for long term accumulation. From backtest it usually makes 100-300% gains over a year period. 
It takes a hit from market dumps unless you intervene but it also recovers fast. 
Cool thing is, you still control it so if you want it to buy something or stop buying all together you can",long,
t1_gsl23jj,Once upon a time BAT was free to withdraw from Uphold but those days are long gone with the kind of gas prices we are seeing now. The best thing I can think of doing is just converting it on Uphold to something quick and cheap to send like stellar and selling it on Coinbase. Might even just be able to convert it to fiat and send it straight to to your bank account.,long,
t1_gsmz8rt,"First... hypothetical or not, the fact is that so long as Venezuela has the level of hyper inflation they have, there is little that can be done. They don't have to invest in Bitcoin, there are a ton of other decentralized coins that are much more stable than their currency is right now and the fees are minimal. It takes you very little to actually get going. The biggest obstacle to getting people in Venezuela is education. I have several friends in the country and their main issue is helping people get on the train, once they are on it is easy to keep them floating. But the government doesn't have any interest in doing that. Maduro has been an illegitimate president of the country for 2 years now and the only way he keeps the power is to keep the people too hungry to fight. 

So hypothetical or not, the only way to prevent this from happening again is to have decentralized currencies with easy access so that people can get in and out of them at any time. If a government doesn't have the people's best interest in their mind, the people can own their destiny by putting their money elsewhere.

As far as the US is concerned, you are sorely mistaken if you think we are too immune to hyperinflation. We are, in fact, in an uncontrolled inflation right now. We are using a CPI which is a crap indicator of inflation... the US government claims the inflation to be at under 2% when in fact it is between 4-6% this very moment. Look at the Big Mac Index and you'll see the cost increase... and don't laugh at it... it's a much better indicator of inflation than CPI will ever be. 

The point of the inflation in Venezuela is to suppress the will of the people, it is a way of the government to suppress the voice of the people by keeping them too busy with figuring out where they will feed themselves so they don't have time to think about how to deal with Maduro's bullshit.",long,
t1_gsmqqul,"The government did try to use the oil to help the population. They sold the oil and made huge social moves, and from 2000 to 2008 (so as long as oil price was high...) extreme poverty got reduced by 70%. It's when other countries didn't want their oil anymore than everything went south...",long,
t1_gsn17f9,"I also think the same, and sadly you get downvoted for your honest opinion.

People think Latin American countries crisis just happened post year 2000, but it has been for years. Lot of countries suffered military coups after WWII, and have been with help from the US because the fear of communism surge, those military coups did to many bad things that have been the foundation of the future crisis, from creating economic black holes to also generating ideological crisis that its x10000 worse on what you can see in the US as you are republican or you are democrat. Then, all the research progress that the US killed for fear that they go on the wrong way, for example you can search on missile and space program on Argentina and see how advance it was, but the US ordered to shut it down and we as puppets say yes ser!! And then a lot more stuff that would be a huge text wall...

Worse thing you can see it on Cuba, how after such a long time they keep choking them... i mean why?? whats the point on still doing so many blockades and economical punishment on that tinny island...",long,
t1_gsn52mi,"Absolutely. The US has a long history of imperialism, which just isn't talked about enough. The damage it has caused to countries is insane. The US, the true ""leader of democracy,"" has [overthrow democratically elected governments in favor of monarchies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27état).

Talking about the massive achievements of democratically elected leaders like [Evo Morales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales) is controversial because there was a [US backed coup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_political_crisis), which means they must've done bad things! 

You can't talk about the countless of achievements of Cuba, like its [literacy campaign that abolished illiteracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_literacy_campaign), [providing free high quality education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Cuba), [reporting lower infant mortality rates than the US and Canada in 2017](https://fee.org/articles/why-cubas-infant-mortality-rate-is-so-low/), [making incredible improvements to its healthcare and life expectancy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Cuba), and other achievements, without getting backlash either.

t3_mf0eos,Comprehensive List Of The Most Basic Useful Essentials About Cryptocurrency. *UPDATE* v2.0,etc,
t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**. 

*Nobody will tell you truly, how to get rich. They want to make rich off you !*

Some of us are watching YouTube, to do his own DYOR, to lean one someone’s else’s opinion, to find a motivation, to learn more about projects. When you don’t know where to look for research, YouTube may came to your mind. While some of the YouTubers are providing some good Technical Analysis, others are making use of their own subscribers  for their own good.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###EXCHANGES

Simply, Exchanges are Platforms. Platforms that we’re using every day to trade our cryptocurrencies for other assets, including either FIAT or digital currencies. They act as **intermediary** between the seller and the buyer. For this job, we’re paying them the transaction fees or commissions.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

##NOTE TO ALL :
**This Comprehensive List Of All The Basic Useful Threads** should only be used for an educational purposes **ONLY**. I am not forcing anyone to listen, read and use these posts for your present and future investments. In my opinion we should learn from them.

It started with meme weekends, then, crypto success stories typically referring to buying something with crypto to give to someone in need, their family, themselves, etc. People caught on to the same-y sob stories and heart throbs, so now it’s more of a, creative-writing exercise to see who can make the most believable/and/or controversial post.

The core of all of this is countered by the people who just blatantly say “THIS POST IS NOW A MOON MINE, WE LIEK DA MOON”",etc,
t3_mf7x77,"Changing perspective on ""not your keys, not your coins""",etc,
t3_mf7x77,"I’m a big believer in the “not your keys not your coins” mantra that is popular in this sub. I store almost all my crypto on a hardware wallet, and only keep a small amount on reputable exchanges. 

That being said, I recently had a conversation with a friend that began to change my perspective on the matter. Essentially, his argument boils down to the following points:

The technical details of who “owns” the coins doesn’t matter as much as some people would lead you to believe. The large majority of people just want to earn money from crypto, and at the end of the day most should store them in the place where they are least likely to lose their funds. (Obviously there are  exceptions to this rule, for instance if you use participate in DeFi, need your private keys to stake, etc, or actively use your crypto for purchases). You can feel superior by having your own hardware wallet, but if you were told that you were 1.5x more likely to lose your funds, would you still use one?

Now that 1.5x number is completely made up as it’s hard to quantify the exact relative risk, but you hear far more stories of people having their keys stolen or lost than of reputable exchanges being hacked (keyword being \*reputable\*, don’t store anything on shady/small exchanges). Do I trust myself more than a $100B tech company who’s business is dependent on not getting hacked? 

Furthermore, if you lose your own keys, you’re 100% screwed. If Coinbase got hacked, they have some insurance and would likely try and refund their customers (perhaps in USD), or else they would surely go out of business. And I know some exchanges wouldn’t do this, but the major players have insurance, billions of assets under management, and deep pockets from funding as well.

Honestly, I think it was a good argument that made me start to rethink how I store my crypto. I’ll still use a hardware wallet for likely the majority of my crypto, but will consider splitting up my funds more evenly. 

I fully expect this to be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I do think the issue isn’t completely black and white. At the very least, storing some crypto on a major legit exchange is a way to hedge against my own stupidity.",etc,

[Session 6 Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m60zkf/taking_genslers_blockchain_and_money_mit_course/?)

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues


Next session: Public Policy",etc,
t3_mewxqj,Serious question: Can I sue Voyager or report to the SEC?,etc,
t3_mewxqj,"So, I’ve had about a month to think about this, and I don’t know what to do. 

I typically use Coinbase pro, but wanted to buy ADA and DOT, so I downloaded voyager. I bought these along with a few other coins. In total, without getting too specific, I spent between 3 and 5 thousand dollars.

I used the app for about 3 months, everything seemed to be going well. I really liked the UX of the app, actually. 

One day, I went to check my coins and I was logged off. Usually, it took my Face ID or a passcode to get in to my Home Screen. No big deal, I thought. I keep meticulous records of all my login names/emails, passwords, and recovery codes. 

I typed in my email and password which was accepted then I was sent to the 2fa screen. I opened my Authenticator app but My voyager rotating code of 6 digits wasn’t on there anymore. Weird. I went in to my records and found my recovery code and entered it. This was accepted as valid and a code appeared. 

Unfortunately, the codes did not match and I could not log in. From here, I tried everything under the sun to trouble shoot. I deleted the app and re downloaded it. I made sure my time zones were accurate, etc. 

I emailed customer support about a month ago at this point with no reply. They don’t have a phone number and they specifically state not to email more than once. 

I don’t know what to do. This is a significant amount of money for me. I have thousands of dollars worth of crypto that I can’t access. 

To me, this is unacceptable. From a technical standpoint, I’ve done nothing wrong. This is clearly a account glitch of some kind. I was attracted to crypto partly because I was tired of feeling fed up with banks. And now here I am. 

It’s one thing to make a stupid purchase or lose money in a volatile market, it’s another thing entirely to have a supposedly reputable exchange just take it. 

I’m angry and want access back (to send elsewhere of course, no way I would keep using their service now). I am absolutely willing to put in the time to sue in small claims court. Can I do this?

Does the SEC want to know since I won’t be able to file taxes on this now?",etc,
t1_gsmix8m,"I can't believe all these comments and no one is talking about the decentralization aspect. Yes, Coinbase is not going to steal your crypto. They're also less likely to be hacked than you are to bungle your private keys holding them yourself. And they're very likely to make you whole again even if they are hacked. 

BUT, possibly the biggest point of crypto is self-sovereignty! It's the ability to control your own money and escape the self-serving banks. If you're only here for the sick gainz, no need to leave an exchange. If you're here for the technology, then coinbase is nothing but an on ramp. I may trust coinbase to safely hold my crypto, but I don't trust them not to pull a Robinhood, to give me the best interest rate, to let me send my funds wherever I want, etc. That's what ""not your keys, not your crypto"" means in my opinion, not just a warning about losing your funds.",etc,
t1_gsnbejv,"Yes, it happens all the time, and on Coinbase and Binance as well. I saw hundreds of similar posts of people locked out of their accounts over the years.

Where do you get the 48 hours from? If your worried about people stealing something from your safe, what makes you think that those people can't get access to your phone which can access the email account and has the authenticator? With the email account, you can change basically everything on the exchange, e.g. whitelist. Also, there are all kinds of sophisticated attacks especially for crypto transactions, e.g. changing the transaction settings (receiving adress, amount etc) right before you click send or after you copied it to the clipboard. A hardware wallet shows you everything on its own display and no one can change that.

Isn't a yubikey a bit similar to a hardware wallet? Then you probably already have done more for your security than 99,9% of the exchange users. And we're talking about those, aren't we?",etc,

Trends can be foreseen if you read daily articles and make your analysis, people are just lazy. As a certified trader I tell you that people can really do it if they put some time into it. 

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really. There aren’t any other competitors in the blockchain supply chain niche.

t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",etc,
t1_gsmr99r,"You can go to a site like coinmarketcap or coingecko and look at the recently added coins.

It's also a very interesting investment.

I got into BTC relatively late but I'm still well in profit. I'm holding some BTC. I have to laugh when I hear all the HODL-at-all-costs Sufi circle stuff. Same with the ""Bitcoin will change the world"" crowd. At best, they're just trying to pump bags they've been holding for many years. I owe BTC absolutely nothing. None of us do. I am still trying to make the big money that the early BTC buy-and-hold lot did. THAT is the holy grail - the 10x / 100x / 1000x unknown coin that turns out to have a use case and a massive momentum behind it.

BTC has done very, very well as an investment asset over its history. That doesn't mean it will continue to do so.

I tend to find that if the BTC ""true believers"" are right, then BTC is actually a relatively stable store of value. However, that feels like a trap. Nothing is stable. Not even gold. As we know, the price of BTC is vulnerable to whale activity. Whales can crash BTC easily if they want. As a retail investor I don't like that but I'm willing to go along with it as long as the prospect of big gains are there. In other words, big-time tail risks and unknowns are fine with me, as long as it's VOLATILE. And it's not as volatile as it was, is it.

Comparisons with altcoins show that BTC volatility tends to be a lot less than altcoins. This is despite the fact that BTC gets pumped more than any other crypto. Big money goes towards funding Youtube channels, moderating opinions on Reddit, etc. to pump the price of BTC. And what do we see? The next ATH could be a mere 7% upswing, and the same investment into altcoins could have seen a 40% upswing, as we've seen with Cardano recently. Hmmm...

Ethereum is so godamn expensive because everyone wants to use it.  Sad people are getting scammed into thinking that BNB is an alternative to projects such as ETH, ADA, DOT, etc, that have actual use cases.

Also, keep in mind there are hundreds of coins that are dirt cheap to transact with (hell Nano is free and it has 1% of BNBs valuation).  It's because, while they are cheap, they have other trade-offs such as scalability, security, or in BNB's case: decentralization.

Have long term plays in areas that you think will have growth, DeFi, NFTs, storage, energy, oracles, whatever.

t3_mf1xqa,How to save yourself from the stress and waste of time in trading and looking at charts,etc,
t3_mf1xqa,"After years of learning, stressing out, doing horrible emotional mistakes, i found my way of dealing with the fear of missing out in trading and the trading itch.  


Creating your own bot that does everything automatically for you 24/7.  
This way you are free to do whatever else you want with your otherwise wasted time looking and analysing charts and focus on accumulating aswell as having some trading on the side.  
 

I'm not saying this is better/worse, i'm just saying it's the alternative i found for me and has been working out.

  
The bot is always exposed to the market so if you let it run without interveining (prevent it to stop buying for a period or force sell current positions etc) it will also get losses but from backtesting the strategy and live testing it i noticed it always recovers over time, and better than i would trading anyway. 

But it is always under your control.

Also this post is merely representative and only scratches the surface of the bot's capabillities, there's tons more depth to this framework but i linked all the documentation you need :)   


My bot results since live trading starting a month ago:

How i made the bot and what can it do?  


[Bot commands \(not all are listed here\) ](https://preview.redd.it/eanc95zu2sp61.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a12f1e381722e06d1c8694a6e7d412adf204b8c)

Using a FOSS Python framework done by [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/), hosting it on a raspberry pi 4, but can also be hosted on a vps for example.  


I chose freqtrade because it has great documentation, API and TG integration so you can easily interact and control the bot from telegram and it also supports ML hyperoptimization for your strategy.

You can also plot and visualize your strategy and it has tons more features. You can do pretty much anything with python.  


After installing freqtrade, (guide in the webpage),  you will have to develop a strategy based on buying signals that you populate using parameters, in my case indicators from TA lib.

[MyStrat](https://preview.redd.it/n1pazo2e3sp61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2454afab44e58d44cda715b7a3e743e016998f22)

They have a git repo with alot of free strategies you can start with and try/change:

[free strats :)](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade-strategies)  


Once you develope your strategy you can downlaod data from an exchange through your api keys and backtest the strategy against it and analyse/improve it for different time periods.

[backtesting results](https://preview.redd.it/m7v1ooke4sp61.jpg?width=423&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a28c9ebf61c38a289b189a36d4ffde922bc66380)

You then can use ML and optimize your parameters and Stop loss values and ROI table (rules that the bot uses to take profits according to trade duration) and you also have features like trailing stop loss etc. 

[Hyperoptimization](https://preview.redd.it/horwpqfg4sp61.jpg?width=901&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf7e41335fef469cdb2a1270198ef1bd5dc2f62)

After the hyperopt is finished, you get a new set of parameters that improve your strategy based on the data you input. After that it's rinse and repeat until you are satisfied with your strategy.

Lately I have been storing a big chunk of my funds on binance, I even get 6% interest so it is preferable.

Single point of failure is never good.",etc,
t1_gsn6k2a,"That's a good perspective to have. I think in such cases, the factors of owning your coins are based on-

1. Reputation of exchanges
2. Government's policies on cryptocurrency
3. Self-Discipline to be-your-own-bank (Taking care of seed phrases, etc)

I like having the liberty of putting my coins in my wallet instead of leaving it in the exchanges simply because I'm gonna hold for a while and chances are, I'm DCA-ing in more than I am DCA-ing out. It works differently depending on how active you are in the market as well.",etc,

Blockfi does monthly payout and Celsius does it weekly, Iv honestly not had any issues with them.  They do good sign up bonuses etc too",etc,
t1_gsm1zj2,"All I'll say on this is that to make that comparison, truthfully and honestly, you're going to need a proper assessment of the following things:

* how many developers and client teams are working on the protocol itself
* how many teams are working on Dapps across the ecosystem
* the contents of the protocol and Dapp updates, their likely impact on the ecosystem, and what they unlock for all other developers/teams working on things in the ecosystem
* when those protocol upgrades and Dapp updates are scheduled to be released
* the true (not manipulated) amount of activity taking place on the blockchain and how that breaks down
* the amount of activity taking place and value being transacted on the  various Dapps (or Dapp sector eg Defi, NFTs, gaming etc)

Sure, money printer and debt count go brrrr is ""bad"" for the status quo, but the status quo is just keeping the NPCs on financial life support.  The world reserve currency going into hyper inflation will accelerate the transition from fiat into equities and decentralized virtual currencies.  That's a good thing for anyone who isnt mooching off future generations via sovereign debt.",etc,

-Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.

t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

**I would like to ask you kindly to suggest some more USEFUL** threads or links in the comment section below.

##NOTE TO ALL :
**This Comprehensive List Of All The Basic Useful Threads** should only be used for an educational purposes **ONLY**. I am not forcing anyone to listen, read and use these posts for your present and future investments. In my opinion we should learn from them. Otherwise, use this list as a white paper/ starting point on your journey, not as your “get rich quick scheme” or “business plan”.

*I am not a financial advisor. I am not taking any responsibility for the things that were showcased.*",white,
t3_mf7x77,"Changing perspective on ""not your keys, not your coins""",white,
t3_mf7x77,"I’m a big believer in the “not your keys not your coins” mantra that is popular in this sub. I store almost all my crypto on a hardware wallet, and only keep a small amount on reputable exchanges. 

That being said, I recently had a conversation with a friend that began to change my perspective on the matter. Essentially, his argument boils down to the following points:

The technical details of who “owns” the coins doesn’t matter as much as some people would lead you to believe. The large majority of people just want to earn money from crypto, and at the end of the day most should store them in the place where they are least likely to lose their funds. (Obviously there are  exceptions to this rule, for instance if you use participate in DeFi, need your private keys to stake, etc, or actively use your crypto for purchases). You can feel superior by having your own hardware wallet, but if you were told that you were 1.5x more likely to lose your funds, would you still use one?

Now that 1.5x number is completely made up as it’s hard to quantify the exact relative risk, but you hear far more stories of people having their keys stolen or lost than of reputable exchanges being hacked (keyword being \*reputable\*, don’t store anything on shady/small exchanges). Do I trust myself more than a $100B tech company who’s business is dependent on not getting hacked? 

Furthermore, if you lose your own keys, you’re 100% screwed. If Coinbase got hacked, they have some insurance and would likely try and refund their customers (perhaps in USD), or else they would surely go out of business. And I know some exchanges wouldn’t do this, but the major players have insurance, billions of assets under management, and deep pockets from funding as well.

Honestly, I think it was a good argument that made me start to rethink how I store my crypto. I’ll still use a hardware wallet for likely the majority of my crypto, but will consider splitting up my funds more evenly. 

I fully expect this to be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I do think the issue isn’t completely black and white. At the very least, storing some crypto on a major legit exchange is a way to hedge against my own stupidity.",white,
t1_gsma7h9,"It's a concern when people who know little of computers are suddenly thrust into controlling private keys. The problems that arise are not only losing the keys, but bad practices unfortunately commonly seen. For example, storing screenshots on their phone of their private passwords; keeping the wallet app installed on their phone or computer; using the same device they use for entertainment as they do for dealing with wallets; and falling victim to bad actors, such as fake websites, fake apps, fake support, fake giveaways.

However, I believe with proper education people can avoid these pitfalls, and as a result use wallets to keep their coins secure as possible.

Some exchanges are reputable, and some otherwise. The ability for any one person to get on a reputable exchange depends on the region they're from, and also the coins available for purchase plays a major role. It's common for people to end up on less-than reputable exchanges, and it's also common for people to end up on the reputable ones. But for this reason, I believe it's a good rule of thumb that ""Not your keys, not your coins.""

But here's the problem. We'd expect a $100B company to have fantastic security and could avoid getting hacked, but the sad reality is that many of these companies lack the most in cybersecurity. I've seen it time and time again over the years, not just in cryptocurrency, but over the entire sphere of the internet from large to small companies. Having insurance is great, but regulations are not like they are for, say, the stock market. If a severe enough hack were to occur, I'd seriously be concerned over the company's ability to reimburse people. And at the end of the day, we don't really know what's going on behind the scenes of a company, and their internal practices. For example, why do 100B companies tend to have such horrible, horrible support? You'd expect the opposite. In the same way, we can say this for cybersecurity. You'd expect it to be great, but we're in an era where even cybersecurity experts don't know what the heck they're doing, and simply sound good on paper.

But I agree, if someone hasn't taken the time to properly learn about cryptocurrency, and educate themselves, then they can be their own worst enemy. And for this reason, I can see it making a lot of sense to just stick with exchanges. But I always recommend people learn about wallets and safety related to that, and get to a point they can control their own coins fully.

t3_mf0eos,Comprehensive List Of The Most Basic Useful Essentials About Cryptocurrency. *UPDATE* v2.0,ethereum,
t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

https://preview.redd.it/gtfwdp3z8vp61.png?width=426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a985867329521a2c068e82a0dc49ee7e77d82528

I’ve had some strange experiences in my career as a journalist. But nothing even remotely prepared me for the experience of watching total strangers competing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a picture of my words.

A few weeks ago, I decided to write a column about the rise of nonfungible tokens, the hottest craze in the cryptocurrency world, with a meta twist: I would [turn the column itself into a NFT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html) and put it up for auction, with the proceeds going to The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund.

When I pitched the idea to my bosses, I thought the stunt might attract a handful of bids from curious Times readers who had spare Ethereum, the cryptocurrency being used for the auction, burning a hole in their digital wallets. Maybe we’d raise a few hundred dollars for charity and explain the complicated process of creating and selling NFTs along the way. I set the auction’s minimum price low — 0.5 Ether, or about $800 — and was nervous I might not get even that much.

Instead, the auction became a circus. I listed it on Wednesday morning, and before I went to bed that night, the top bid had risen to more than $30,000. When I woke up the next morning, it was $43,000. In the final hour of the auction, I watched, slack-jawed, as a last-minute bidding war broke out.

$98,000.

$143,000.

$277,000.

After more than 30 bids, the auction ended at 12:32 p.m. Eastern time, with a [winning bid](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129) of 350 Ether, or about $560,000. A few minutes later, after the auction platform had taken its cut, nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrency landed in my digital wallet. I was stunned. Congratulatory texts and media requests started pouring in. My colleagues joked about stiffing the charity and slipping off to the Cayman Islands. My editor said I shouldn’t expect a raise.

The whole ordeal was surreal, and it raised the question: Why would anyone spend the price of a high-end Lamborghini on a picture of my words? After all, the NFT was just a cryptographic signature linked to an image of a column that anyone could read on The Times’s website, albeit with a few bonus perks. (I also stipulated that I would feature the winner’s name and photo in a follow-up column, and Michael Barbaro, the host of “The Daily,” gamely agreed to throw in a voice message for the winner.)

The winner, whose [handle on the auction site was @3fmusic](https://foundation.app/3FMusic), appeared to be a prominent NFT collector. The profile on the site was linked to a Twitter profile belonging to a Dubai-based music production company, and to an Instagram account identified as that of Farzin Fardin Fard, the company’s chief executive. The user’s NFT collection included a variety of other expensive digital works, including a $14,000 “emoji portrait” of the musician Billie Eilish and a $8,000 piece titled “Jumping Spider enjoying coffee in the morning.”

I reached out to u/3fmusic to offer my congratulations on the purchase and to discuss the bid. They (it’s not clear if the winner is Mr. Fard or some other individual or multiple people) declined to be named — and, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain-based transactions, there’s no easy way for me to identify them beyond the information they volunteered — but they sent me a statement over Twitter direct message that read:

“We are already involved in art and media for a long time now,” the message read. “Our management team is always in cooperation with some highly knowledgeable and experienced art advisers who believe that we must grow with technological movements that help us to not only promote our business but also to support artists and the art market. Thus, we have proudly decided to dedicate sufficient funds and resources to invest in NFT as pioneers of this industry.”

They also gave me permission to include an image of their music studio’s logo in this column.

Jiannan Ouyang, an NFT collector who dropped out of the auction after a high bid of 290 Ether (about $469,000), told me that he had decided to bid on my NFT for both personal and professional reasons. He’s a former Facebook research scientist who is now a blockchain entrepreneur, and he’s married to a journalist.

“This column reflects the thoughts we exchange daily about how the NFT technology will reshape the modern media and advertising industry,” he told me.

Some NFT collectors believe that owning early, prominent crypto-tokens will eventually be like owning rare, first-edition books or priceless paintings. Mr. Ouyang admitted that the value of my NFT was “still highly speculative and subjective.” But he said he believed that NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies would ultimately reshape the entire media landscape, allowing creators to reimagine how they create and monetize their works.

“This particular NFT from The New York Times is one of the answers and will become a historical landmark in this inevitable movement,” he said. “That’s why I think it is valuable.”

Rulton Fyder, a pseudonymous NFT artist who declined to be named, topped out at a bid of 21 ether (about $34,000). He echoed Mr. Ouyang’s thoughts that my NFT might someday have historical significance, and said that beyond the stunts, NFTs were creating a “new digital value system” that was worth taking seriously.

“People from my generation who grow up in the 1970s will love to collect first edition books, novels such as Ulysses by James Joyce,” he wrote in an email. “What crypto and NFT opened up is the ownership of the rights to say one owns such a thing, whether tangible or intangible, in a form that thousands if not millions can see and track the ownership in real time, anywhere in the world.”

André Allen Anjos, an electronic musician from Portland, Ore., who bid 5.69 Ether (about $9,200) on the NFT, told me in a phone interview that bidding on the token could be seen as a symbolic gesture of thanks from the crypto community to me and The Times for, essentially, taking them seriously enough to experiment with our own token sale.

“It’s like, here’s a mainstream publication trying to interact with us as a community in an earnest and real way,” he said. “I wanted to signal, ‘Hey, this is cool, you’re asking the right questions.’”

Mr. Anjos said he had grown up in the era of Napster, when musicians first realized that the internet could destroy their livelihoods by making it free and easy to duplicate songs. Blockchain technology, he said, had changed that by making it possible to create limited-edition collectibles stamped with a digital marker of their provenance.

Collecting NFTs, Mr. Anjos said, was less about owning the pieces themselves — most of which can be freely downloaded from the internet, albeit without their special cryptographic signatures — and more about signaling belief in this new model of ownership.

“I’m not going to call it a protest, but it’s a statement,” he said. “This is the crypto world trying to prove that we’re here, we care about revolutionizing this entire model, and we’re willing to put our money on it.”

“My thinking was: Maybe a photoshop of my face, or some type of super pro-Bitcoin ‘you stuck it to The New York Times’ thing,” he said.

Bidding on NFTs, he said, had become a kind of sport among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, many of whom have been sitting on huge virtual piles of Ethereum and Bitcoin for years. Every NFT auction produces a public record of bids, and high-profile auctions can attract a crowd of people just hoping to be noticed among the losers.

“The bid itself is becoming marketing,” he said.

But Mr. Agrawal clarified that some bids were less strategic, and more about showing off.

“A lot of the NFT buyers at this high level are fabulously wealthy, and they’re just collecting for the sake of collecting,” he said.

In addition to readers who eagerly followed along with the NFT auction, I did got some questions from people who worried about the environmental impact of promoting NFTs that use the Ethereum blockchain. (The Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, requires vast computational power, and [critics have called it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) an emerging environmental hazard.) I fully support developing less computationally intensive ways to do blockchain transactions, and to mitigate any harmful effects of this experiment, I’m personally buying $400 in carbon offset credits — enough to offset about 100 times as many carbon emissions as I generated by auctioning off this NFT.

And as soon as I can figure out how to do the transaction without completely screwing up my taxes, I’ll be sending roughly 300 Ether — worth about $497,000, at the current market price — [to the Neediest Cases Fund](https://www.nytimes.com/column/neediest-cases).

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues


Next session: Public Policy",ethereum,
t3_mexb51,DeFi explained: NFTs,ethereum,
t3_mexb51,"What are NFTs? And what can you do with them? In this post I’ll try to answer these questions.

# What is an NFT?

If you want to understand the concept of NFT, you must first know what a Fungible token is. NFT stands for Non-Fungible token. An important property of a fungible token or “normal” token is that they are interchangeable - You can exchange bitcoins with each other, the value is equally divisible for everyone - bitcoins can be divided into parts and you can exchange them. For example: 0.003240000 BTC.

An important difference with the Fungible tokens is that the NFTs have a unique aspect and cannot be replicated. This unique aspect is encoded in the token's metadata. Think of it as a certificate of authenticity.

## Some features of NFTs:

* They are unique, this allows you to identify items with them.
* They are not divisible.

The latter has the advantage that you can only claim right to a certain product, service or other object such as an art object. Compared to a real-life example; a football ticket for the match is for one person. You cannot share this ticket with multiple people. There is one seat available for you in the grandstand.

## What can you do with NFTs?

The NFTs have already entered the gaming industry. However, there are plenty of applications to come up with in other situations as well. Think of; birth certificate, diploma, or ID. All these unique items can be ""tokenized"". Tokenizen is digitizing a certain asset and linking it to the blockchain, such as art.

## NFTs vs normal tokens

Another difference between normal tokens and NFTs is the protocol they run on. The normal tokens run on the Ethereum protocol: ERC-20.

For Non-fungible tokens there is a choice of two protocols: ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Of which ERC-721 is the most used. ERC-1155 is slightly newer and less used.

The ERC-1155 protocol has been developed to enable developers to implement this protocol in a smart contract in a smart and efficient way. This can then be used to generate unlimited fungible (identical) tokens and non-fungible (unique) tokens.

The ERC-721 protocol, on the other hand, is used to generate non-exchangeable tokens, forcing developers to implement a new smart contract for each new token.

## Non-fungible tokens and gaming: Crypto Kitties

A well-known example using ERC-721 tokens is Crypto Kitties. Each ERC-721 token in that game is a unique digital cat.

You can breed these with the help of another digital cat and create new cats. The new cats can then be bought and sold on the platform.

## Decentraland

Another good example of a platform that utilizes NFT's is Decentraland. The name already gives it away: it is a (virtual) world that is completely ""built"" on blockchain. It can be compared to Simcity: you buy a virtual piece of land, on which you can build and develop whatever you want. Nobody decides what you can build, you are completely free. In addition to buying virtual land, you can also trade other unique assets with other players in the form of NFTs.

## Ethernity chain

Ethernity Chain, a new player to the game, is developing a community-centric platform for digital artists to create limited edition NFT lines. Ethernity Chain enables users to own unique digital artifacts and artwork, which are tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This is of particular appeal to the gaming, music and sports industries. However, the scope for NFTs is unprecedented. Ethernity Chain addresses this with the use of Authenticated non-fungible tokens (ANFTs).

## NFTs in the future: What can you expect from them

One development in which NFTs can play a major role is DeFi. Decentralized Finance. This topic has been growing in popularity in recent years. And the Non-Fungible tokens can play a supporting role in this.

Let's look at an example: a car accident. Two different parties. Two different insurance companies that have to sort everything out among themselves. They need to collect all data. This is a lot easier via the blockchain, because everything is linked. An NFT may contain data about an insurance policy or car. Link smart contracts to this, and you know: you don't have to think about anything yourself. The blockchain will solve it for you.

## Final words

In this post, you’ve learned that non-replaceable tokens are unique and have unique properties. This allows them to be associated with a specific item. In addition, items such as artwork, have different values ​​that make it interesting to use NFTs. Especially in the gaming industry, it is becoming more popular to use NFTs.

t1_gsnezok,"I think Charles has a need to be the one in charge. When he's not– you've read how it's gone. IOHK has done some really impressive work and I wouldn't discredit any of it. I don't think he's a great person though, he's even quoted as something along the lines of: I'm basically a billionaire at this point, those 6 months at Ethereum mean nothing to me",ethereum,
t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”. 

Vitalik got what he wanted with Ethereum and Charles got what he wanted with Cardano. The good vs. evil battle that you are making this out to be is an exaggeration that comes from you “picking a side”.",ethereum,
t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it. One guy cant decide that an update is happening. The miners must accept it.",ethereum,
t1_gsnizn2,"The chain will remain the same.  It's like changing out the engine of a car -- or in this case, the consensus rules.  The blockchain will keep going, all accounts &amp; contracts unchanged -- it'll just be that after some block, the nodes decide which block is the correct next one based on the (already running) beacon chain, instead of hashes submitted by miners.  

If you're connecting in with an Ethereum wallet, or just have some coins on the exchange, there's nothing that'll change.  If you're running a node, make sure to keep your software updated (but everyone should do that anyways :P). 

""ETH2"" is more a name for a set of upgrades which are happening progressively to improve the chain, rather than a ""throw it all away and start over"" kinda thing.  Loosely, refers to PoS &amp; Sharding, but there's a huge number of other features that will have a major impact on usability &amp; capabilities (the list above isn't even exhaustive!)",ethereum,
t1_gsko4of,"So Nexo charged you $20, Ethereum didn’t. 

Why would I use mintable? It requires an account, and apparently costs $1000+ to use; it is therefore terrible and not representitive of Ethereum.

Think your fat dick comment could be fixed by swapping out ‘Ethereum’ with ‘Nexo and Mintable’..",ethereum,
t1_gsnkwt9,"Conflicting yes but only because different use case. Ethereum can't do properly what it was built for hence pos upgrade.....when it actually happens. Bitcoin can stay how it is because it's now a store of value. It would be useless as a global payment system, slow tx speed, price fluctuates way too much. 

Ethereum can do both, but not one as good as bitcoin, nor the other as good as algorand.

Mind that you're still putting a certain amount of trust into the wbtc project when you convert. The wbtc custodians hold funds on BTC and mint / burn WBTC on Ethereum. They are centralized entities, and when you deposit BTC with one of them, you are trusting their servers and software to issue you the corresponding amount of ERC20 tokens at the market rate.
The major difference with traditional custodians is that you can verify the BTC held in trust (i.e. you can perform your own audit) using this dashboard https://www.wbtc.network/dashboard/audit.",ethereum,
t1_gsmu3ay,"I’ll just talk facts regarding D=0 Day for Cardano...

All blocks will be produced by independent stake pools after the current Epoch ends.  With roughly 70% of all ADA in circulation staked, this will make Cardano a very decentralized ecosystem.  There’s also over 2000 stake pools now all over the world.  I’m located in the US, but I actually delegate to pools in Ireland, England, and the US through 3 different wallets.

The price of this event should be baked in to the current price of ADA.  Long time holders have been watching the progress bar towards total block production by the Cardano Community.

Now my opinion...

The Cardano Community is invested into Cardano just like the Ethereum Community is invested into Ethereum.  There’s also many people invested in both.  I see a scenario where both are successful.  If this happens, all of crypto benefits.  The scenarios where one or both fail are actually very bad for the alt coin space as a whole.  The constant bashing of both projects only degrades cryptos as an investment.  You don’t see the suits on Wall Street constantly bashing competitors.  They know it serves no purpose and will not equal winning. What equals winning is beating the competition by making the best product, having the best service, reaching more and more of the population, and being professional as fuck when every one around you is on the playground. Amazon doesn’t bash Walmart.  Amazon improves.  Amazon researches.  And Amazon wins.  They only care about the competition insomuch as to how to stay one step ahead.  Walmart doesn’t say a damn word about Amazon.  They just improve and launch their own 2 day shipping.  Amazon responds by trying next day.

I’m all in ADA with only a scant amount of ETH at the moment but you know what...I’m not afraid to say it...

I hope Ethereum improves.  I hope they solve all of the problems the network has now and in the future.  It will make Cardano always push.  I hope both win.  I hope I win.  And, if you’re all in on Ethereum, I hope you win.",ethereum,
t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",ethereum,

t1_gsl7xqy,This is a very interesting article for me since I was looking around for eth defi options just in case eth 2.0 and lower gas fees come earlier than we expect. I have a stupid question to ask though. How are we supposed to get regular btc in to a wrapped form of btc that works on ethereum network. I have only used cefi options like Celsius so am not even sure how I would convert btc to wbtc.,ethereum,
t1_gsnhyw0,"To answer your first question, Ethereum is switching over to PoS as we speak and already has a pretty big token and smart contract economy, remains to be seen if they can pull it off well and reduce the fees though, but a lot of people are invested in it.

Bitcoin cash also has smart contacts, tokens and NFT's.

What sets Algorand apart from these two options?",ethereum,
t1_gsnire1,"I told you what sets algorand apart from ethereum in the last comment. As for bitcoin cash it's still p.o.w and what runs 100tps? Good luck with mass adoption. Algorand runs  1000tps with 46k in the works. a peer to peer payment system which like dash, litecoin, monero ect won't mean anything when cbdcs are the future. But that's just my opinion. I'm not trying to bash other projects but if you read up a little on algorand it becomes a lot clearer. You can also stake algo in the official wallet for 6% apy. Pretty decent",ethereum,
t3_mf44b2,"For those who are unclear on big things happening soon in the Ethereum ecosystem, here is a handy timeline!",ethereum,
t3_mf44b2,"So, every week I update a post in r/ethfinance which shows the big things upcoming in the ETHosphere. Posting here as hopefully some of you will get a kick out of it too. If you are unsure as to exactly when the long planned Eth2 or scaling upgrades are happening, this post is for you.

In the other sub I will post a bunch of context on what has changed this week, but here I'll just present the timeline. Links provided if you want to dig deeper on each project. I realise that it assumes a ton of prior-knowledge about Ethereum jargon, so to intro this, basically there are two big threads happening in Ethereum right now...

Firstly, the impending Eth1 / Eth 2 upgrades. These are codenamed Berlin (April), Altair (June), London (July) and Shanghai (late 2021). For those with a little Eth knowledge, the highly anticipated upgrades will be London, which delivers the fee burning, issuance reducing EIP-1559, and Shanghai, which should deliver the Eth1/Eth2 merge, at which point Ethereum fully adopts Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus layer. Keep in mind PoS is already live since December, but it isn't until the merge that proof of work is replaced by PoS.

Secondly, scaling. Everybody knows that fees on Ethereum are absolutely horrendous right now. In some ways this is a good problem to have as it demonstrates how immensely valuable and used Ethereum is, even at this stage of its development, but that's not to say it doesn't need to be resolved. Ethereum has chosen to take an approach where it scales initially (this year) using rollups technology (of several varieties, as you can see below), to be followed next year by sharding. Launches of rollups solutions are highly anticipated, as are dapp upgrades that implement these rollup solutions (eg Uniswap).

A big thing to note is that this list is by no means comprehensive. There are waaaay too many awesome projects being delivered every week in Ethereum, I've just tried to pick out the most notable.

Hopefully that makes sense and some find this useful.

t1_gsnkwz1,"I don’t think people really grasp all that is going on in Ethereum. Partly because all of these things are new and complex, and partly because the ecosystem is so vast (with many different teams working on many different solutions) it can seem fractured and meandering at times. Real decentralization has this effect. 

There’s currently ETH 2.0 with POS transition, dozens of different L2s building and launching, EIP-1559 to improve gas (and likely the ETH price), upgrades to popular dapps like UNI and SNX to L2s with adjusted tokenomics. Even many competing chain L1s integrating via bridges and EVM to stay relevant.

Snx could be a game changer if it can steal more of the derivatives market, Agi with its AI potential, nano is still appealing, and there could be many little guys ready to step it up (moonswap, dragonchain).

Whether it can make sense to fork would depend on the opportunity cost of doing so. In order to pay miners any revenue, a blockchain first needs to create value for users for there to be a valuable block subsidy, congestion fees and MEV. This would need to come from somewhere on a forked chain.

Building traction with users is a lot easier when you can also fork a blockchain’s state, and all successful forks of the past have done just that.

But Ethereum’s state is more complex, containing not just the distribution of Ether, but also thousands of different tokens, smart contracts, applications, and so on. These would also be copied in a fork, but they would be mere skeletons on another chain.

Duplicating the claim wouldn’t duplicate the asset. These claim tokens would continue to operate on the PoS Ethereum chain, but be worthless on the fork chain.

TL:DR; The emergence of tokenized assets and Defi has made Ethereum’s state unforkable.",ethereum,

Coinbase is shortly to offer ETH staking as well, I presume also for amounts less than 32 ETH, but this is obviously a centralised service, so could theoretically take your ETH (admittedly the risk with Coinbase is no doubt low). The fees will likely be much higher on Coinbase though.",ethereum,
t1_gslsj79,"Ethereum earned, I think fairly imo, a reputation for delays when the roadmap was flipped and Proof of Stake was pushed back significantly. There are many well-reasoned arguments for why this is/was a good idea, including from Vitalik himself, but there's no doubt that it sowed doubt in a lot of peoples' minds, particularly those not close to the technical side of the project.

However, I would argue, that since the launch of the proof of stake beacon chain in December last year (the very first phase of Eth 2.0) the teams have been on point and trying their best to deliver as quickly as possible, now to the point where there is a real possibility that the eth1 /eth2 merge could be delivered this year vs 2022 originally.

t3_mf7po5,"Bitcoin dominance currently sits at 61%. On January 13, 2018, Bitcoin dominance hit an all time low of 35%.",eth,
t3_mf7po5,"**What is bitcoin dominance?**

[Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) is bitcoin's marketcap dividend by the marketcaps of all cryptocurrencies combined. It shows how much value bitcoin has versus the all cryptos combined. This is important because it shows the relative strength of altcoins over time. For most of bitcoin's lifetime (pre-2017), dominance sat at over 98%. Bitcoin was the entire market. But since the first altcoin boom in 2017, it has never come close to that peak again.

**Why did it happen?**

There are a few reasons why bitcoin value relative to the rest of the crypto market fell so dramatically in 2017. One major reason was the bitcoin cash fork that occurred in July 2017. Bitcoin cash gained momentum throughout late as the ""true"" bitcoin because of miner support while bitcoin was suffering from network congestion and high fees. There were calls that ""the flippening"" was going to occur in early 2018 and there would be a mass exodus of bitcoin supporters moving to bitcoin cash. This never ended up happening and bitcoin cash rapidly fell off after this point. 

Another reason was that other established altcoins at the time like eth, litecoin, dash and monero had huge rallies and hit their all time highs versus bitcoin. While they are similar prices today against the USD, they are still well off their all time highs vs. bitcoin.

The third reason was the first ICO boom. Hundreds of new ICOs hit the market from late 2017 and early 2018. Today we are seeing a similar boom of new ICOs and shitcoins hitting the market.

**What does this mean?**

Bitcoin dominance sitting at 65% means that alt season could run for quite a bit longer. If we see another nosedive of bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance going back below 50% would mean that altcoin values would have gained hundreds of billions in value. While the altcoin market has absolutely surged over 2021, its still far from its all time highs in early 2018. I think the altcoin market will continue to boom.",eth,
t3_mf0ohx,Best ways to put your BTC into a passive income,eth,
t3_mf0ohx,"This article wants to mainly open a discussion about the best CeFi / DeFi solutions to create value from your BTC bag.

BTC is probably the backbone of many portfolios here, hence is no joke when you choose to stop plain hodling into your cold storage and put your crypto at work producing more crypto: if you decided to get away from the *not your keys, not your coin* golden rule you have to put into serious consideration the benefits and risks. That quote is one of the best pieces of advice, but no dogma.

My personal experience, so far, has been with **BlockFi**, which granted me a 6% APY on BTC (tier1, from 0 to 1 BTC [the rates will change from the 1st of April](https://blockfi.com/our-btc-and-eth-rates-are-changing-and-heres-why)). I chose it for the emphasis on security, for being straightforward: no need to lock or to hold a platform coin, and for the possibility of letting me choose the cryptocurrency in which I could receive interest payments (which allowed me to mainly switch from BTC to ETH payouts when the circumstances were favorable or I wanted to rebalance my portfolio).

But this is not a BlockFi post, on the contrary, as I wrote earlier, Tier2 rates have been changed and heavily penalized. Other interesting possibilities I can find in the CeFi environment are **Nexo** (probably the most interesting, we start at 6% at the base loyalty level, but only if you choose to receive payouts in NEXO tokens, otherwise it's 4%), **Celsius** (5,10% if you choose the payout in CEL, otherwise in-kind reward rate is 4,06% APY - edit: US rates are different and provide a compelling 6,2% till 2 btc and 4,06% after) and **Crypto.com**, which are recently doing some interesting steps forward, between the 70 Billion CRO burned last month and the mainnet launched 3 days ago, aiming to decentralize the coin. In the latter, the APY can vary from 1,5% to 8,5% depending on the locked period and CRO staking.

On the DeFi side, you'll need to first tokenize your BTC, which will have to be converted in an erc-20 token before dedicating yourself to yield farming. wBTC and renBTC are examples of 1:1 BTC pegged tokens.

Some interesting options in the DeFi environment, can be found on **Curve** where, according to Coinmarketcap, the hBTC-wBTC pool grants a 7,62% APY, payout in CRV, with low impermanent loss: Another option is the **Harvest Finance** wBTC vault, with a lofty APY of 17,91%, payout in FARM and CRV, and still low IL, but at the same time a higher risk profile ( it's worth noticing that this DeFi protocol was hacked last October 2020 with 24M stolen).

This is a very fast overview, coming from my personal experience and research, with the risk/reward ratio to be always kept in mind. However, my main goal here is to open a discussion about your experience on BTC yield farming and CeFi/DeFi tools, being the brainstorming coming from this community always helpful. Personally, once I will feel more comfortable with DeFi, I will opt for decentralized protocols, being decentralization the reason why crypto is crypto.

Edit: check also the **Badger.finance**, a decentralized organization/community driven project (DAO), focused on BTC farming, with its BADGER token and two products: Sett (vault, DeFi aggregator with flash loans mitigation measures) and DIGG (non custodial synthetic BTC). The yelds look quite attractive.",eth,

t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”. 

Vitalik got what he wanted with Ethereum and Charles got what he wanted with Cardano. The good vs. evil battle that you are making this out to be is an exaggeration that comes from you “picking a side”.",eth,
t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it.

The site Tapcrypto . Co has payment proofs and links.  Many of the telegram bots I have found somewhat untrustworthy, especially if it's ETH related. Due to gas ETH faucets are just not plausible, so they should be viewed skeptically. DogeClick is the operator of the Telegram Bots I use in particular and don't really try other advertised bots.

Deflating the supply of coins constantly and rewarding holders for holding.

t1_gsmu3ay,"I’ll just talk facts regarding D=0 Day for Cardano...

All blocks will be produced by independent stake pools after the current Epoch ends.  With roughly 70% of all ADA in circulation staked, this will make Cardano a very decentralized ecosystem.  There’s also over 2000 stake pools now all over the world.  I’m located in the US, but I actually delegate to pools in Ireland, England, and the US through 3 different wallets.

The price of this event should be baked in to the current price of ADA.  Long time holders have been watching the progress bar towards total block production by the Cardano Community.

Now my opinion...

The Cardano Community is invested into Cardano just like the Ethereum Community is invested into Ethereum.  There’s also many people invested in both.  I see a scenario where both are successful.  If this happens, all of crypto benefits.  The scenarios where one or both fail are actually very bad for the alt coin space as a whole.  The constant bashing of both projects only degrades cryptos as an investment.  You don’t see the suits on Wall Street constantly bashing competitors.  They know it serves no purpose and will not equal winning. What equals winning is beating the competition by making the best product, having the best service, reaching more and more of the population, and being professional as fuck when every one around you is on the playground. Amazon doesn’t bash Walmart.  Amazon improves.  Amazon researches.  And Amazon wins.  They only care about the competition insomuch as to how to stay one step ahead.  Walmart doesn’t say a damn word about Amazon.  They just improve and launch their own 2 day shipping.  Amazon responds by trying next day.

I’m all in ADA with only a scant amount of ETH at the moment but you know what...I’m not afraid to say it...

Smart contracts were copy and pasted to BNB simply so CZ could pump the fuck out of it to noobs on twitter (which works very well actually, just ask Tron).

Ethereum is so godamn expensive because everyone wants to use it.  Sad people are getting scammed into thinking that BNB is an alternative to projects such as ETH, ADA, DOT, etc, that have actual use cases.

Also, keep in mind there are hundreds of coins that are dirt cheap to transact with (hell Nano is free and it has 1% of BNBs valuation).  It's because, while they are cheap, they have other trade-offs such as scalability, security, or in BNB's case: decentralization.

But primarily between Treasures and Planet, I roughly added it this week and has made about $12 just in my free time or boredom.

In the other sub I will post a bunch of context on what has changed this week, but here I'll just present the timeline. Links provided if you want to dig deeper on each project. I realise that it assumes a ton of prior-knowledge about Ethereum jargon, so to intro this, basically there are two big threads happening in Ethereum right now...

Firstly, the impending Eth1 / Eth 2 upgrades. These are codenamed Berlin (April), Altair (June), London (July) and Shanghai (late 2021). For those with a little Eth knowledge, the highly anticipated upgrades will be London, which delivers the fee burning, issuance reducing EIP-1559, and Shanghai, which should deliver the Eth1/Eth2 merge, at which point Ethereum fully adopts Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus layer. Keep in mind PoS is already live since December, but it isn't until the merge that proof of work is replaced by PoS.

Secondly, scaling. Everybody knows that fees on Ethereum are absolutely horrendous right now. In some ways this is a good problem to have as it demonstrates how immensely valuable and used Ethereum is, even at this stage of its development, but that's not to say it doesn't need to be resolved. Ethereum has chosen to take an approach where it scales initially (this year) using rollups technology (of several varieties, as you can see below), to be followed next year by sharding. Launches of rollups solutions are highly anticipated, as are dapp upgrades that implement these rollup solutions (eg Uniswap).

A big thing to note is that this list is by no means comprehensive. There are waaaay too many awesome projects being delivered every week in Ethereum, I've just tried to pick out the most notable.

Hopefully that makes sense and some find this useful.

t1_gsnkwz1,"I don’t think people really grasp all that is going on in Ethereum. Partly because all of these things are new and complex, and partly because the ecosystem is so vast (with many different teams working on many different solutions) it can seem fractured and meandering at times. Real decentralization has this effect. 

There’s currently ETH 2.0 with POS transition, dozens of different L2s building and launching, EIP-1559 to improve gas (and likely the ETH price), upgrades to popular dapps like UNI and SNX to L2s with adjusted tokenomics. Even many competing chain L1s integrating via bridges and EVM to stay relevant.

I’m very curious about mining lately. My buddy and I are somewhat talking about building a rig together and letting it mine ETH for us as we are both long term bullish on the coin.

t1_gsm1zj2,"All I'll say on this is that to make that comparison, truthfully and honestly, you're going to need a proper assessment of the following things:

* how many developers and client teams are working on the protocol itself
* how many teams are working on Dapps across the ecosystem
* the contents of the protocol and Dapp updates, their likely impact on the ecosystem, and what they unlock for all other developers/teams working on things in the ecosystem
* when those protocol upgrades and Dapp updates are scheduled to be released
* the true (not manipulated) amount of activity taking place on the blockchain and how that breaks down
* the amount of activity taking place and value being transacted on the  various Dapps (or Dapp sector eg Defi, NFTs, gaming etc)

Coinbase is shortly to offer ETH staking as well, I presume also for amounts less than 32 ETH, but this is obviously a centralised service, so could theoretically take your ETH (admittedly the risk with Coinbase is no doubt low). The fees will likely be much higher on Coinbase though.",eth,

There are many well-reasoned arguments for why this is/was a good idea, including from Vitalik himself, but there's no doubt that it sowed doubt in a lot of peoples' minds, particularly those not close to the technical side of the project.

However, I would argue, that since the launch of the proof of stake beacon chain in December last year (the very first phase of Eth 2.0) the teams have been on point and trying their best to deliver as quickly as possible, now to the point where there is a real possibility that the eth1 /eth2 merge could be delivered this year vs 2022 originally.

With POS, there is still some centralization because the whales can have like 1000s of staking nodes. Because it is 32 eth to stake so they have like 32000 so they can basically setup so many validator nodes and make a good passive income.


Furthermore, its harder for smaller players to stake because 32 x 2000 = 64k to setup a validator node.",eth,
t1_gsn9e1y,"Okay, this is making sense. So for smaller investors below 32 ETH, do they still get rewarded as well?",eth,
t1_gsndpws,"You can't stake on your own without 32 eth. But there are exchanges like coinbase and also rocketpool that lets you stake with less than 32 eth. So say you have 10eth. Then they will combine your eth with other people's and stake. Then you get a percentage of the cut of the interest. This will be less than if you set up a staking system yourself as the exchange will take a bit of commission.

The more multiples of 32 eth you have, the more you can make. Also, it depends on how much eth is in the system. So if there is less than a million eth, then you can get 18% return with just 32 eth. With more than 100 million, you get 1.8%.",eth,

Are these changes actually ""Forks"" and people need to prep for claiming forks? (Heard that's a giant pain, risky, and not exactly supported everywhere..?)

Or do these updates merge (hey you said merge 🤷‍♂️) back into the current ETH down the road (shanghai / 2022)?

Alternatively, if you're stuck unable to claim a fork at the open, is there a timeline to claiming after a fork starts or is it indefinitely available (ie platform you're on takes forever to figure it out)?

Trends can be foreseen if you read daily articles and make your analysis, people are just lazy. As a certified trader I tell you that people can really do it if they put some time into it. 

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really. There aren’t any other competitors in the blockchain supply chain niche.

Conclusion: You can’t predict the price, but you can study and learn more about what goes into the price changes from the projects, and make your decisions based on your research.",uniswap,
t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",uniswap,

In the other sub I will post a bunch of context on what has changed this week, but here I'll just present the timeline. Links provided if you want to dig deeper on each project. I realise that it assumes a ton of prior-knowledge about Ethereum jargon, so to intro this, basically there are two big threads happening in Ethereum right now...

Firstly, the impending Eth1 / Eth 2 upgrades. These are codenamed Berlin (April), Altair (June), London (July) and Shanghai (late 2021). For those with a little Eth knowledge, the highly anticipated upgrades will be London, which delivers the fee burning, issuance reducing EIP-1559, and Shanghai, which should deliver the Eth1/Eth2 merge, at which point Ethereum fully adopts Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus layer. Keep in mind PoS is already live since December, but it isn't until the merge that proof of work is replaced by PoS.

Secondly, scaling. Everybody knows that fees on Ethereum are absolutely horrendous right now. In some ways this is a good problem to have as it demonstrates how immensely valuable and used Ethereum is, even at this stage of its development, but that's not to say it doesn't need to be resolved. Ethereum has chosen to take an approach where it scales initially (this year) using rollups technology (of several varieties, as you can see below), to be followed next year by sharding. Launches of rollups solutions are highly anticipated, as are dapp upgrades that implement these rollup solutions (eg Uniswap).

A big thing to note is that this list is by no means comprehensive. There are waaaay too many awesome projects being delivered every week in Ethereum, I've just tried to pick out the most notable.

Hopefully that makes sense and some find this useful.

t1_gsma9m9,"Keep learning about them, there are huge differences among cryptos.

Last year’s game changers IMO were link, aave, compound, maker, and uniswap. They enlarged the whole playing field. 

This year there is a lot of momentum behind blockchains like dot, ada, algo, tezos, cosmos, and even polygon helping ethereum. 

Gaming and media are getting bigger (enjin, theta, etc), nfts are still new (nif, lyxe), and then there’s the manufacturing industry (vet, mrph). 

Snx could be a game changer if it can steal more of the derivatives market, Agi with its AI potential, nano is still appealing, and there could be many little guys ready to step it up (moonswap, dragonchain). 

There’s obviously a crap ton more I didn’t mention but I hope this gives a good picture. The field is wide open with possibilities. I wouldn’t rule out any of these coins.",uniswap,

Tether just minted a very significant amount of new coins. 

What are your thoughts on this considering the allegations against them? I consider this a big deal and am unsure why no one is talking about this.

This at least deserves a conversation. For those unaware Tether has been accused of minting new coins without having the fiat to back it. FUD?

Edit: It won't let me link it in a post.

Edit2: My goal here is to not scare people, I have skin in the game just like everyone here. I hope this is just nothing, but we shouldn't ignore something like this. Why won't they let auditors review their balance sheets?",tether,

Also, in the crypto space, fiat is eschewed, which is what tether essentially is.",tether,
t1_gslotw2,"There's basically ironclad evidence (imo proof) that on more than one occasion that tether wasn't backed.

I think tether is probably fully backed, and a major part of that is crypto assets which they bought with minted tether. I would still consider that not backed.

Give it time. Tether has to start publishing information about its backing either end of this quarter or in may, and then quarterly thereafter, so we'll see.

I still would work with the assumption that USDT is worthless in the meanwhile, and I believe the peg won't hold and will fail sometime soon.",tether,

A legit exchange like coinbase only needs 1.3b in total to facilitate trades and tether is over 40.6 billion of issues tethers.

Mock my words when tether collapses the market will drop like a stone. That’s not FUD; it’s reality. We’ll finally get to stock up on BTC cheap though lol

Most likely case to me is there's bank runs on exchanges that provide a fiat pair (kraken) and a lot of people fucked on exchanges that don't(kucoin) and defi. Bank runs on kraken shouldn't affect people not holding tether since the kraken team doesn't maintain the peg. Even kucoin should be relatively unscathed besides being illiquid for a time.",tether,

t3_mf0eos,Comprehensive List Of The Most Basic Useful Essentials About Cryptocurrency. *UPDATE* v2.0,bitcoin,
t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

t3_mf7po5,"Bitcoin dominance currently sits at 61%. On January 13, 2018, Bitcoin dominance hit an all time low of 35%.",bitcoin,
t3_mf7po5,"**What is bitcoin dominance?**

[Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) is bitcoin's marketcap dividend by the marketcaps of all cryptocurrencies combined. It shows how much value bitcoin has versus the all cryptos combined. This is important because it shows the relative strength of altcoins over time. For most of bitcoin's lifetime (pre-2017), dominance sat at over 98%. Bitcoin was the entire market. But since the first altcoin boom in 2017, it has never come close to that peak again.

**Why did it happen?**

There are a few reasons why bitcoin value relative to the rest of the crypto market fell so dramatically in 2017. One major reason was the bitcoin cash fork that occurred in July 2017. Bitcoin cash gained momentum throughout late as the ""true"" bitcoin because of miner support while bitcoin was suffering from network congestion and high fees. There were calls that ""the flippening"" was going to occur in early 2018 and there would be a mass exodus of bitcoin supporters moving to bitcoin cash. This never ended up happening and bitcoin cash rapidly fell off after this point. 

Another reason was that other established altcoins at the time like eth, litecoin, dash and monero had huge rallies and hit their all time highs versus bitcoin. While they are similar prices today against the USD, they are still well off their all time highs vs. bitcoin.

The third reason was the first ICO boom. Hundreds of new ICOs hit the market from late 2017 and early 2018. Today we are seeing a similar boom of new ICOs and shitcoins hitting the market.

**What does this mean?**

Bitcoin dominance sitting at 65% means that alt season could run for quite a bit longer. If we see another nosedive of bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance going back below 50% would mean that altcoin values would have gained hundreds of billions in value. While the altcoin market has absolutely surged over 2021, its still far from its all time highs in early 2018. I think the altcoin market will continue to boom.",bitcoin,
t3_mey1y7,Stop checking your portfolio: the statistics and psychology behind explained,bitcoin,
t3_mey1y7,"This will be a boiled down argument for why you should stop checking your portfolio hourly, daily and even weekly - and what intense portfolio-looking does to you.

1. The biggest and easiest to explain factor is glaringly obvious when explained and it comes down to statistics. If you expect 100% gains during a 1 year investment, it will not go up all the time during those 525.600 minutes of the year. At best, it will be up from the last minute, maybe 10.000 times more than it will be down. Say you check bitcoins price every minute 51/100 times it will be up (this is even generous). This is important, because og the theory in psychology that states losses cause more hurt than gains reward in terms of happiness.

But if you check daily instead of per minute, you might be up 200/365 days. That’s significantly up from 51/100. Now if you check monthly, you might be up 8/12 og 9/12 months (from the last month) assuming a 100% expected yearly return. (This is a high apy, but still applies to a low one, but let’s be real, if ur in bitcoin you expect high returnand volatility)

If you are a holder believing in bitcoin, you’re better off checking as few times as possible since variances in prices on daily candles are insignificant compared to the long term, and what you are seeing is the outcome of randomness. When you factor in the psychology of loss and gain, your mental will lose every time when checking often. By checking the price monthly or twice monthly, what you see is bitcoins actual price movement and not the result of daytraders random results.

2. Becoming too invested in your investment. Dedicating your time to checking your portfolio also takes time away from other productive things (or even just watching tv). If you’re not planning on changing your investment, there’s no reason to be checking it often since no matter how many times you do so, it’s still going to be the same price in 1 month as if you didn’t check. Spend that time watching tv instead, it’s better than wasting time watching random outswings in price.

3. Being down from your ATH is frustrating. 
By checking bitcoins price often, you make sure you will be seeing the price being DOWN from the ATH 99% of the time. If you check it less, chances are you still won’t be seeing the ATH.. but instead of being 15% down from ATH you shift your focus to being up 10% since you checked last month.
This third reason could vary from person to person with it being insignificant to some people.


TL;DR:
By checking your portfolio often, you’re just checking the results of daytraders random outcome. Checking less often gives you a clearer indication of bitcoins actual price moment. 

Psychological principles say losses hurt more than wins gain - leaving your unconscious mood to be decided by daytraders is probably not in your interests when investing in bitcoin. 

Check less often for higher chance of being up from when you last checked to be affected less by random, insignificant price actions. This applies if you’re a bitcoin bull in a bull market.",bitcoin,
t3_mfdfiw,Analyze: When the bull market ends? 4 indicators.,bitcoin,
t3_mfdfiw,"  

**Short answer: Nobody knows! This is not financial advice.**

Long answer: Nobody knows, but there are some indications. Still not financial advice.

**1 / Market cycle duration**

First bitcoin cycle was around 15 months. Second one was 36 months. Third one was 48 months. So, you could conclude as market cap grows, each cycle becomes slower at accumulating more capital. So far, this cycle has been 26 months from the bottom. If the trend is going to continue, this cycle still has a lot to offer.

**2 / Market cap peak trendline**

If we draw the trendlines from previous cycles ([chart by Peter Brandt CEO of Factor LLC](https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-11.20.35-AM-775x446.png?format=webp)), it seems that we still have room before reaching the peak area. This trendline is based on very few data points, but if the market is going to behave the same way, it appears that we are in in the middle of the current cycle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbfijdSZAU) for more info. 

**3 / Ratio between long-term holders to short-term holders.**

In simple terms, in the last bull-markets short-term holders increased and long-term holders decreased to certain levels when we approached the end of market cycle. [In this chart](https://i.imgur.com/eGEwsHQ.png) you can see this ratio (and the [mathematics behind it](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/rhodl-ratio/)), going to red area indicates that we are near the end of cycle.

**4 / Stock to flow model**

For 'store of value' commodities there has been a useful model which has predicted the value of assets like gold and silver. Since bitcoin behaves similarly, it has been successful at predicting bitcoin too. Each time the real price deviated from the model; it went back to it.

t3_mffksj,Apps To Earn Crypto,bitcoin,
t3_mffksj,"I am relatively new to all of this, and I have not had spare money to buy crypto, so I have had to rely on stuff like moons in this subreddit, tips, faucets, drops, and apps to earn bits of free crypto here and there. I wanted to mention some of the apps I have used and see if you all had others that you recommend. I have an Android, so I do not know if these are on Apple or not. 

**Quicrypto** and **TipNano**

These two are similar that they both allow you to earn crypto through watching ads, doing surveys, or using other apps/playing games. They do have slight differences. In Quicrypto you accumulate generic points, which can be redeemed for Nano or Bitcoin. TipNano only allows you to get Nano and has a longer initial setup, however it also has a faucet within the app that you use every couple of hours, and you get small bonuses for opening the app daily. 

Quicrypto has a Piggy Bank that appears to be a one time deal (if you can activate it again, I do not know how.) It accumulates bonus points until you break it open. 

Some of the offers they use include Playtime Offers, which reward you for playing games. You download mobile games and get rewarded just for having the app open, though there is a diminishing return. At first, new apps reward you every few minutes, but that increases gradually until you are getting nothing until the app has been open for an hour or two. 

I believe Theorem Surveys and InBrain Surveys seem like decent survey sites that give rewards even if you don't qualify for a survey, so your time doesn't feel wasted. 

**WeNano**

WeNano is like a super simplified Pokemon Go. There are spots on a real world map. If you are within range, you can enter the spot and get Nano. However, the app seems to be a bit slow, in my experience. 

While there are not currently many spots available, if you zoom out, click on the filter, and turn off everything except Show Special, you should be able to find one or two large spots that you fit in. There is a World spot just NW of Hawaii that you can claim daily. And many countries or continents have a spot as well. I know the US has a weekly spot, as does Central America. 

**Bitcoin games by Bling**

Bling has made 5 pretty basic mobile games (Bitcoin Blocks, Food Fight, Solitaire, Blast, and Pop) that reward points that can be redeemed for very small amounts of Bitcoin on Coinbase. Your account can be connected to all of the games, so you can see your total number of points. You can redeem them for Bitcoin once per week. The games have a stamina system, and your ""lives"" refill every 12 hours.  From what I can tell, points are not awarded based on performance in the game. It kinda seems random.

Bitcoin Food Fight seems like the fastest app if you aren't interested in any of the games themselves, but it is pretty repetitive. 

*You end up having to watch a lot of ads.*

**Merge Cats** and **Merge Dragons**

By Sergey Zasorin in the app store. Both of them say Earn Crypto Reward or Earn Cryptocurrency after the name. These games are exactly the same with a different skin. They are super simple. They award a crypto called SOUL, which seems to currently be worth about 0.34 dollars per 100 SOUL. They seem to be working on another game. I have not tried to redeem or trade this currency, yet, so I do not know how smooth the process is. It seems you can stake on their website if you get up to 50,000 SOUL. 


I tried a couple other apps like Crypto Connect 3 that awards Phoneum and Green Karma but was not really impressed with either one. 

**TLDR:** These apps do *not* rake in currency, but if you are bored or waste time with shitty mobile apps anyway, you might be interested? Or maybe you have a recommendation with more promise?

t3_mfch3u,Actually unpopular opinion : Venezuela is not a Bitcoin usecase. Hyperinflation was a byproduct of oil price crashing leading to diminished importation and scarce goods. Money printing was only the final nail in the coffin. A quick recap on the Venezuelan situation and how inflation works.,bitcoin,
t3_mfch3u,"Venezuela is often mentioned as a Bitcoin usecase, pointing out that the relentless Bolivar printing caused hyperinflation and Bitcoin could fix this. While partially true, it's not the whole picture.

First you gotta know that Venezuela almost doesn't produce ANY of the goods they consume. EVERYTHING that the population eat, drink, and use everyday is from importation. Second, Venezuela's main exportation activity is oil as it is one of the biggest oil reserve in the world (90+% of the country's exportations is oil), so Venezuela basically trades its imported good for its oil (simplification, there is some forex dynamics behind this). 

Now since 2008, oil price have been crashing. In addition, Venezuela's oil production have been diminishing more and more. Add to that economic sanctions from the US like various embargos and political maneuvers, and what happens?

Goods become scarce. Revenue from oil exportation does not cover the cost of importation needs anymore. In addition your previous partners now refuse to trade with you anymore. Food, consumables, everything : there now isn't enough for everybody and you have to fight for it. 

Now one puny band-aid Maduro tried to use was money printing. In normal times, money printing either increase production or increase prices. When there is more money around, people either buy more stuff which companies respond to by increasing production, or the production of said stuff is already saturated so price rise. In a healthy economy (the US for example), the main impact is on production, which boost the whole economy further more and makes the country more powerful : that's why Central Banks are so addicted. That's the reason consumer inflation does not follow the money supply increase in the US, but instead the money goes into stocks as companies thrive from the increased consumption. 

Now back to Venezuela. Money printing can't make the oil wells produce more, which is Venezuela's most prominent business. Of course it does not increase importation either... So the only effect it could have was price increase on the goods, which became very scarce due to the aforementioned problems. Money printing could have been a solution if the economic crisis was a short-lived period as it would have briefly boosted the importation power of the country, but instead in this situation where the problems ran deep, it only made everything worse.

Bitcoin could have fixed the poor economical decisions of Maduro, but it would not have magically fixed the intrinsic problems of Venezuela, which was an economy too dependent on oil and too dependant on foreign importation to sustain itself. 

tl;dr : Venezuela's real problems come from an economy too focused on oil exportation and too dependent on importations, not from its monetary policy. Bitcoin does a lot of thing, but it cannot save the economy of a country that's deeply flawed.",bitcoin,

t3_mfebl8,"Bidders say they had many different motivations, including fun, self-promotion and a signal of support for the NFT market.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gtfwdp3z8vp61.png?width=426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a985867329521a2c068e82a0dc49ee7e77d82528

I’ve had some strange experiences in my career as a journalist. But nothing even remotely prepared me for the experience of watching total strangers competing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a picture of my words.

A few weeks ago, I decided to write a column about the rise of nonfungible tokens, the hottest craze in the cryptocurrency world, with a meta twist: I would [turn the column itself into a NFT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html) and put it up for auction, with the proceeds going to The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund.

When I pitched the idea to my bosses, I thought the stunt might attract a handful of bids from curious Times readers who had spare Ethereum, the cryptocurrency being used for the auction, burning a hole in their digital wallets. Maybe we’d raise a few hundred dollars for charity and explain the complicated process of creating and selling NFTs along the way. I set the auction’s minimum price low — 0.5 Ether, or about $800 — and was nervous I might not get even that much.

Instead, the auction became a circus. I listed it on Wednesday morning, and before I went to bed that night, the top bid had risen to more than $30,000. When I woke up the next morning, it was $43,000. In the final hour of the auction, I watched, slack-jawed, as a last-minute bidding war broke out.

$98,000.

$143,000.

$277,000.

After more than 30 bids, the auction ended at 12:32 p.m. Eastern time, with a [winning bid](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129) of 350 Ether, or about $560,000. A few minutes later, after the auction platform had taken its cut, nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrency landed in my digital wallet. I was stunned. Congratulatory texts and media requests started pouring in. My colleagues joked about stiffing the charity and slipping off to the Cayman Islands. My editor said I shouldn’t expect a raise.

The whole ordeal was surreal, and it raised the question: Why would anyone spend the price of a high-end Lamborghini on a picture of my words? After all, the NFT was just a cryptographic signature linked to an image of a column that anyone could read on The Times’s website, albeit with a few bonus perks. (I also stipulated that I would feature the winner’s name and photo in a follow-up column, and Michael Barbaro, the host of “The Daily,” gamely agreed to throw in a voice message for the winner.)

The winner, whose [handle on the auction site was @3fmusic](https://foundation.app/3FMusic), appeared to be a prominent NFT collector. The profile on the site was linked to a Twitter profile belonging to a Dubai-based music production company, and to an Instagram account identified as that of Farzin Fardin Fard, the company’s chief executive. The user’s NFT collection included a variety of other expensive digital works, including a $14,000 “emoji portrait” of the musician Billie Eilish and a $8,000 piece titled “Jumping Spider enjoying coffee in the morning.”

I reached out to u/3fmusic to offer my congratulations on the purchase and to discuss the bid. They (it’s not clear if the winner is Mr. Fard or some other individual or multiple people) declined to be named — and, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain-based transactions, there’s no easy way for me to identify them beyond the information they volunteered — but they sent me a statement over Twitter direct message that read:

“We are already involved in art and media for a long time now,” the message read. “Our management team is always in cooperation with some highly knowledgeable and experienced art advisers who believe that we must grow with technological movements that help us to not only promote our business but also to support artists and the art market. Thus, we have proudly decided to dedicate sufficient funds and resources to invest in NFT as pioneers of this industry.”

They also gave me permission to include an image of their music studio’s logo in this column.

Jiannan Ouyang, an NFT collector who dropped out of the auction after a high bid of 290 Ether (about $469,000), told me that he had decided to bid on my NFT for both personal and professional reasons. He’s a former Facebook research scientist who is now a blockchain entrepreneur, and he’s married to a journalist.

“This column reflects the thoughts we exchange daily about how the NFT technology will reshape the modern media and advertising industry,” he told me.

Some NFT collectors believe that owning early, prominent crypto-tokens will eventually be like owning rare, first-edition books or priceless paintings. Mr. Ouyang admitted that the value of my NFT was “still highly speculative and subjective.” But he said he believed that NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies would ultimately reshape the entire media landscape, allowing creators to reimagine how they create and monetize their works.

“This particular NFT from The New York Times is one of the answers and will become a historical landmark in this inevitable movement,” he said. “That’s why I think it is valuable.”

Rulton Fyder, a pseudonymous NFT artist who declined to be named, topped out at a bid of 21 ether (about $34,000). He echoed Mr. Ouyang’s thoughts that my NFT might someday have historical significance, and said that beyond the stunts, NFTs were creating a “new digital value system” that was worth taking seriously.

“People from my generation who grow up in the 1970s will love to collect first edition books, novels such as Ulysses by James Joyce,” he wrote in an email. “What crypto and NFT opened up is the ownership of the rights to say one owns such a thing, whether tangible or intangible, in a form that thousands if not millions can see and track the ownership in real time, anywhere in the world.”

André Allen Anjos, an electronic musician from Portland, Ore., who bid 5.69 Ether (about $9,200) on the NFT, told me in a phone interview that bidding on the token could be seen as a symbolic gesture of thanks from the crypto community to me and The Times for, essentially, taking them seriously enough to experiment with our own token sale.

“It’s like, here’s a mainstream publication trying to interact with us as a community in an earnest and real way,” he said. “I wanted to signal, ‘Hey, this is cool, you’re asking the right questions.’”

Mr. Anjos said he had grown up in the era of Napster, when musicians first realized that the internet could destroy their livelihoods by making it free and easy to duplicate songs. Blockchain technology, he said, had changed that by making it possible to create limited-edition collectibles stamped with a digital marker of their provenance.

Collecting NFTs, Mr. Anjos said, was less about owning the pieces themselves — most of which can be freely downloaded from the internet, albeit without their special cryptographic signatures — and more about signaling belief in this new model of ownership.

“I’m not going to call it a protest, but it’s a statement,” he said. “This is the crypto world trying to prove that we’re here, we care about revolutionizing this entire model, and we’re willing to put our money on it.”

“My thinking was: Maybe a photoshop of my face, or some type of super pro-Bitcoin ‘you stuck it to The New York Times’ thing,” he said.

Bidding on NFTs, he said, had become a kind of sport among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, many of whom have been sitting on huge virtual piles of Ethereum and Bitcoin for years. Every NFT auction produces a public record of bids, and high-profile auctions can attract a crowd of people just hoping to be noticed among the losers.

“The bid itself is becoming marketing,” he said.

But Mr. Agrawal clarified that some bids were less strategic, and more about showing off.

“A lot of the NFT buyers at this high level are fabulously wealthy, and they’re just collecting for the sake of collecting,” he said.

In addition to readers who eagerly followed along with the NFT auction, I did got some questions from people who worried about the environmental impact of promoting NFTs that use the Ethereum blockchain. (The Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, requires vast computational power, and [critics have called it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) an emerging environmental hazard.) I fully support developing less computationally intensive ways to do blockchain transactions, and to mitigate any harmful effects of this experiment, I’m personally buying $400 in carbon offset credits — enough to offset about 100 times as many carbon emissions as I generated by auctioning off this NFT.

And as soon as I can figure out how to do the transaction without completely screwing up my taxes, I’ll be sending roughly 300 Ether — worth about $497,000, at the current market price — [to the Neediest Cases Fund](https://www.nytimes.com/column/neediest-cases).

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues

t3_mewytg,Why $8 Billionaire Soros is Investing in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Suddenly [A Short Article],bitcoin,
t3_mewytg," 

Opinions on cryptocurrencies are very far apart as of right now. It seems there are fewer people who consider this industry to be a bubble. George Soros is a notorious example in this regard. Earlier this year, he claims Bitcoin is a bubble. It seems that comment helped push the price down, which may have been the plan all along.

## The Curious Case of George Soros

Few people were surprised when [George Soros](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/06/george-soros-makes-spectacular-u-turn-cryptocurrency/) claimed Bitcoin is a bubble. In January of 2018, he described cryptocurrrency as a bubble and a misnomer. Moreover, Bitcoin can’t be labeled as a currency because it’s not a stable store of value. All of these comments hold some sort of truth, but they are not entirely factual either.

The volatility associated with Bitcoin has been well-documented in the past. It seems the year 2018 brings us more of the same,. During the first few months, we have seen a lot of bearish [Bitcoin price](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/08/bitcoin-price-weekly-analysis-btc-usds-upsides-remain-capped/) pressure. George Soros considers this to be one of the biggest drawbacks about Bitcoin. Even so, it is possible his comments are designed to purposefully drive the price down altogether. Wall Street players did not take kindly to the Bitcoin price hitting $19,000 late last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether or not the comments by George Soros attributed to the price decline, is always a big question. It is evident Soros is often considered to be a guru became of his “strategic calls based on macroeconomic conditions”. Even so, claiming Bitcoin is a bubble is perhaps the worst assessment of his career. In fact, it seems he did a complete 180-degree turn on cryptocurrencies altogether.

## The Cryptocurrency Investment Decision

Now that the Bitcoin price has dipped quite a bit, George Soros prepares to invest in cryptocurrency. This rather odd decision only fuels speculation involving price manipulation. Even though George Soros still considers digital currencies to be not “actual currencies”, the volatility has suddenly turned him into a believer. Such a sudden change of heart is often part of a bigger agenda.

For the time being, it seems Soros is quite happy with the way things are going for Bitcoin. With the big dip in place, it seems things may improve from here on out. He is not the first [Wall Street ](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/04/coinbase-adds-another-wall-street-exec-scales-institutional-markets/)mogul to invest in cryptocurrencies either. Alan Howard and the Rothschild family are taking very similar steps in this regard. It seems the interest in cryptocurrency is only growing, even among financial experts.

The big question is whether or not cryptocurrency prices can rebound. Right now, it seems the situation is still brittle, as things can change pretty quickly. Even so, the bearish pressure has been prevalent for a very long time. Sooner or later, things will need to improve again. Bitcoin’s price may very well return to the five-digit range in the future. How long that process will take, is anybody’s guess at this point.

t3_mezre6,How I lost hundreds of dollars and somehow came out in the green,bitcoin,
t3_mezre6,"I only very recently entered the crypto space, but have been very aware of bitcoin since 2011 and over the past decade I’ve seen my friends completely change their lives with crypto, So it was time that I finally started investing, things seemed great I was buying every coin my friends told me about and any coin that seemed promising on here,

Now here comes the downside, every coin I bought into was before valentines day, literally every coin was at its ATH and out of my initial $1000 dollars invested I lost hundreds, although I made some of it back over time, nothing was reaching or passing the previous ATH

I was on the fence about investing more because at this point I was scared of potentially loosing more and assumed everyone had shilled me out of my money

Until one night I got on CMC and literally went through the top 600 coins I wrote down every coin with a low market cap and relatively low supply out of those 600 I probably researched 200/300 then I found my two low cap low supply alt coins with crazy potential and solid real world uses, I decided to pull the trigger one last time although one coin was in top 200 and the other was in the top 600, I was then able to triple my investment with one and double my other investment pulling me back in the green and restoring all my hope

Moral of the story DYOFR find a project or company that has real uses and is going to be implemented in the future

t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it. One guy cant decide that an update is happening. The miners must accept it.",bitcoin,

Bitcoin dominance falling is a great bubble indicator because it means the dumb money has started flowing in and people who don't know how to use a printer are now ""crypto investors"".

Alts are going up overall, but so is the number of coins.  Bitcoins one coin, and its going up faster.

I guess, dont underestimate the importance of some btc in your portfolio is my point...",bitcoin,
t1_gsm3fn8,"I kind of agree with you. An asset with ten years of life with such an impressive volatility is not a reliable store of value.

A store of value is the gold, when it ""crashes"" it dips a 5%. Compared to cryptocurrencies, those actually are dips for ants.

In the recent story, it has only actually ""crashed"" once during the 2007 crisis, and it recovered quite fast. 

When it comes to cryptos though, it's not uncommon to see 10 and 15% dips or even more. During bear markets, we've seen -80% from ATH, which is kinda scary for a store of value.

You also make a great point, we haven't seen Bitcoin on a bear market yet. Bitcoin itself has been bearish multiple times, however, it has not lived yet a worldwide recession like the 2007 crisis. How would it behave? No one knows, and thus, it's quite hard to claim it being a store of value.",bitcoin,
t1_gsmi5v1,"&gt;In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.

So the thing is, you're comparing a relatively brand new asset class in bitcoin which is about 10 years old, to a 5,000 year old asset class in gold. There are many reasons why the comparison you're drawing isn't a fair one. For starters, bitcoin is still in its infancy, or price discovery mode, over the course of the next 100 years at minimum. Once we've mined every last bitcoin and only then, would it be fair to draw a comparison to gold as a store of value, in the way you're doing it. 

Basically, people need to calm down with these comparisons and just let bitcoin do it's thing. This is sortof like comparing a high school Michael Jordan to a prime Magic Johnson. Give bitcoin the time it needs before you draw the comparisons.",bitcoin,

t1_gsn4mdk,"Aye, BTC has not seen a sustained economic downturn, yet.

The store of value narrative is still speculative. But there are many of us who are betting on it being one in an economic downturn.

However, if bitcoin is viewed as a risky asset that simply has higher risk adjusted returns than the stock market and this is what is drawing new investment, I would expect a very long crypto winter which I expect for all risky asset classes, especially bond markets.

To put it another way, its an illusion to think the pizza guy made a mistake. Because the exchange was available back then, anyone who paid for pizza in cash made the same error, as they could have spent that cash on bitcoin.

t1_gsm26od,"Take a longer term view.  Make a plan and stick to your plan.  Don't be reactive to the day to day events.  Expect volatility and understand that it can lead you psychologically to make the wrong decisions (e.g., panic selling on dips, panic buying at sharp rises).  Remember that the most successful crypto investors are the dead ones.   Reacting daily, particularly when you're new, is probably a losing strategy.  When you're making a purchase, you should have an idea of if and when you would take profits and how much.  You should also have an idea what you would do if it falls.

Understand and think about your risk tolerance and tailor your plan around it.  Yes, a tiny market cap coin nobody ever heard of has a better chance of going 100x in a single day than the largest market cap coins, but it also has a better chance of dropping to nothing in a day.  Don't put money in that you cannot afford to lose.  Research the coins you're buying.  Trust your (researched) judgment over people you find on the internet.  Understand that when you're hearing a ""crypto celebrity"" on the internet tell you to buy a coin, it's entirely possible it's so they can dump it.

Don't believe anybody who claims they can make precise price predictions over the short term.  Instead, consider dollar cost averaging (DCA).  Take your time and make decisions that you can stand behind.  Don't feel that you need to race into this or you'll miss out (FOMO).

Research and take appropriate security precautions for how you store your crypto.  If you're getting into substantial amounts, don't leave your crypto on an exchange indefinitely.  Make sure you using multi-factored authentication for services you're using that provide it.  Use strong passwords and don't use the same password for different services.  Consider the use of a cold wallet.  Also make a plan for what happens with your crypto if something happens to you.    If someone messages you directly from reddit, there's a good chance it's because they want to try to scam you.  If you're using a hot wallet, be aware there are ""fake"" versions of them sometimes on the app stores.  Make sure you're downloading the official version.  When you're transferring crypto, do it very carefully--i.e., be careful not to transfer from a wallet with one type of coin to a wallet with another type of coin (e.g., from bitcoin to bitcoin cash).  Consider using ""allow-listing"" when using exchanges: i.e., set up the wallets you'd be moving crypto to and restricting transactions to those.  If you are using allow-listing, consider moving a smaller transaction before moving a large amount (yes, you'll lose a little to fees with that method, but it's better than losing your whole stack).  Be careful talking about crypto with friends and family.  Consider the merits of, just, not telling people.

Finally, participate in the /r/cryptocurrency (as you already are).  It's a good time. ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)",bitcoin,
t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",bitcoin,

It's also a very interesting investment.

I got into BTC relatively late but I'm still well in profit. I'm holding some BTC. I have to laugh when I hear all the HODL-at-all-costs Sufi circle stuff. Same with the ""Bitcoin will change the world"" crowd. At best, they're just trying to pump bags they've been holding for many years. I owe BTC absolutely nothing. None of us do. I am still trying to make the big money that the early BTC buy-and-hold lot did. THAT is the holy grail - the 10x / 100x / 1000x unknown coin that turns out to have a use case and a massive momentum behind it.

BTC has done very, very well as an investment asset over its history. That doesn't mean it will continue to do so.

I tend to find that if the BTC ""true believers"" are right, then BTC is actually a relatively stable store of value. However, that feels like a trap. Nothing is stable. Not even gold. As we know, the price of BTC is vulnerable to whale activity. Whales can crash BTC easily if they want. As a retail investor I don't like that but I'm willing to go along with it as long as the prospect of big gains are there. In other words, big-time tail risks and unknowns are fine with me, as long as it's VOLATILE. And it's not as volatile as it was, is it.

Comparisons with altcoins show that BTC volatility tends to be a lot less than altcoins. This is despite the fact that BTC gets pumped more than any other crypto. Big money goes towards funding Youtube channels, moderating opinions on Reddit, etc. to pump the price of BTC. And what do we see? The next ATH could be a mere 7% upswing, and the same investment into altcoins could have seen a 40% upswing, as we've seen with Cardano recently. Hmmm...

There are a few factors that stack against it:

1. The main reason: Ripple and XRP are nearly as old as Bitcoin, first being made in 2011-12. At the time, mining and proof of work consensus was THE way to manage the block chain and monetize network security. XRP (ripple credits at the time) come along and have pre-mined coins (100 billion). A pre-mined coin was the antithesis of what people felt the Block chain could/would/should be.

2. It was advertised to be a bankers coin, a coin that would bridge the gap between banks and the general population with speedy, secure, and cheap transaction. This was also an antithesis to blockchain as people saw banks as the bad guy and blockchain tech was there to shut them down.

3. The founders gifted themselves billions of xrp. However at the time of creation they gave themselves something worth literally nothing. It was about a year later that the coin went to .006 which equated their XRP to about 30 million. Now it's more for obvious reasons.

t3_mf5or1,"Unpopular Opinion. Bitcoin is a hypergrowth tech asset, and not necessarily a traditional recession-proof store of value, and we should be careful with the labels we put to it",bitcoin,
t3_mf5or1,"First of all, before explaining why I believe this, I'll explain what I mean exactly by this.

In this sub, and everywhere in the crypto community, we keep hearing ""Bitcoin is a store of value"", ""Bitcoin is digital gold"" and similar things. According to Investopedia, a store of value is ""an asset that maintains its value, rather than depreciating"", and lists gold as an example. This does not necessarily mean that gold is a better investment than Bitcoin, in fact I believe the opposite, since its inception Bitcoin has been the asset with highest growth.

When we talk about a store of value, we tend to refer to some sort of asset that can provide a decrease in risk to your portfolio during turbulent times. We have very little data that could suggest that Bitcoin is recession-proof or an investment that you should make when your economy is going down, and in fact, most of the little data we have suggests the opposite.

Consider how gold behaved during the 2008 stock market crash. The Dow Jones dropped from 13k in April 28th 2008 to 6.6k in March 2nd 2009, in other words the stock market during that time period almost dropped 50%. In April 2008, gold was at \~1200, and in March 2009 if was at \~1100, with the lowest low reaching \~880 in October 2008, in other words, the price of gold dropped \~27%.

However, Bitcoin wasn't a thing during this time recession, and ever since then we have enjoyed the biggest bull market in American history, leading to all time highs, growth and returns in the tech sector. This was the time when Bitcoin was growing as well.

In fact, the only recession we have had since 2008 was the covid recession, and this is the little data we have about how Bitcoin behaves in a recession:

* Dow Jones dropped from 29.4k in February 10th 2020 to 19.2k in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 35% drop.
* Gold went from 1570 in February 11th 2020 to 1487 in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 6% drop.
* BTC dropped from 10.2k in February 11th 2020 to 5200 in March 17th 2020, a 49% drop.

In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.",bitcoin,

Bitcoin needs the legacy financial system to stay in place, otherwise if people adopt BTC there will be a massive collapse in welfare due to economic transactions coming to a halt because people would be incentivized to hoard currency for a future of even more prosperity which will never come because everybody else is also hoarding and not transacting.

You have a great point though, that $8 of crypto spent on a coffee could become $800 in 5 years. Or $0.80, that's the gamble.",bitcoin,
t1_gsmmnnu,"A good rule of thumb:

Keep your coins on an exchange if you plan to do regular trading (e.g., ""I'm keeping this coin for a day or few days, then trading it for this other coin""). Good to have the coins readily accessible in this case.

Keep your coins in a wallet if you're plan to hold the coins for longer periods of time (e.g., ""I bought Bitcoin, and I'm not selling or trading it for the next few months or years"").

I should clarify it's not necessarily bad to keep your money on reputable exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). It's safer than it used to be. But because of past events in the cryptocurrency sphere, exchanges are met with a level of skepticism. For example, Mt. Gox was an exchange that suddenly went belly-up in 2014 and customers lost all of their BTC -- approximately 850,000 in total. Some might say it was rather unexpected because they were well established and responsible for over 70% of Bitcoin transactions.

But it's a different time now, and things have come a long way. But there's still concerns over security breaches, and whether or not any given exchange would compensate you should such an event occur. And if an exchange were to close its doors, or go bankrupt, what would that mean for us who have money on it? The stock exchange has much better regulations as far as I'm aware, regulations that may protect us against such things as a brokerage going bankrupt. But for cryptocurrency, it's much less regulated so we're much less protected.

Now, having a private wallet is better in the sense that you have 100% control over it. But there's still security concerns depending on how you go about it. You could go with a hardware ledger (most secure), or an app on your phone or computer (less secure, e.g., what if your phone were secretly infected with a malicious piece of software?) But you could inadvertently be your own worst enemy. For example, losing your private keys to the wallet means your funds are lost forever. If your private keys were stored digitally (never recommended), and a bad actor stole them, then it's game over.

Edit: And also, there's additional fees when sending cryptocurrency back and forth between your wallet and exchanges. So this is another reason why, if day trading specifically, it's more profitable to just keep your coins on the exchange. Plus, the coins are there when you need to trade them -- no delays.",bitcoin,

Personally, I love listening to *Speaking of Bitcoin,* a podcast Andreas Antonopoulos is on.

I'd be happy to keep this thread updated with awesome recommendations that I receive for that others may reference it for future use.

t1_gsmy2hg,"I would probably disagree with alot of this.  This is no different than Elon Musk not only not selling any of his Tesla shares, but even buying more throughout this rise.  It's almost certain that currently, Tesla is well beyond fair valuation, but price typically reflects a lot on future value.  

The guy wouldn't invent this and then magically think ""Nah.  Not worth"". Then jump ship. He knew the value long before anyone and knows its value better than anyone on this site.  

He probably won't sell until his vision has come to fruition.  I guarantee the current state of bitcoin is not his vision.  Bitcoin went from basically a scam, to money for criminals, to a meme tipping service, and is currently more at the ""Store of value"" stage with it only beginning to be recognized as legitimate.

I would bet the value of Bitcoins price has absolutely no reflection on this mans decision to sell or not.  I would argue that until this mans vision is fulfilled to fruition, he will not sell anything more than something he might used to live on if needed.  

That being said, I have no idea.  Maybe a meme tipping service was enough for him and he sold around 20k causing the crash.  I have no idea honestly.",bitcoin,

t1_gsmz8rt,"First... hypothetical or not, the fact is that so long as Venezuela has the level of hyper inflation they have, there is little that can be done. They don't have to invest in Bitcoin, there are a ton of other decentralized coins that are much more stable than their currency is right now and the fees are minimal. It takes you very little to actually get going. The biggest obstacle to getting people in Venezuela is education. I have several friends in the country and their main issue is helping people get on the train, once they are on it is easy to keep them floating. But the government doesn't have any interest in doing that. Maduro has been an illegitimate president of the country for 2 years now and the only way he keeps the power is to keep the people too hungry to fight. 

So hypothetical or not, the only way to prevent this from happening again is to have decentralized currencies with easy access so that people can get in and out of them at any time. If a government doesn't have the people's best interest in their mind, the people can own their destiny by putting their money elsewhere.

As far as the US is concerned, you are sorely mistaken if you think we are too immune to hyperinflation. We are, in fact, in an uncontrolled inflation right now. We are using a CPI which is a crap indicator of inflation... the US government claims the inflation to be at under 2% when in fact it is between 4-6% this very moment. Look at the Big Mac Index and you'll see the cost increase... and don't laugh at it... it's a much better indicator of inflation than CPI will ever be. 

The point of the inflation in Venezuela is to suppress the will of the people, it is a way of the government to suppress the voice of the people by keeping them too busy with figuring out where they will feed themselves so they don't have time to think about how to deal with Maduro's bullshit.",bitcoin,

**- Shut up and take my money!**

My parents spent their entire life working and working, they managed to get comfortable in life. But they never really invested in any markets other than the real estate, and only 1 investment in life. I want to say ""thank you"" for how they raised me by educating them about how money works. They taught me how work works, but they never really learned about money.

I own a company in the travel industry, related with transportation and holiday rentals, now jumping into real estate aswell. Im in the South of Europe and this year Im planning on starting a massive shift on the way my company operates. We're going hard on digital. I believe everyone that owns a business should be aware of whats hapenning and whats changing.When my 64yrs old mother understood why crypto isnt a stupid idea from computer nerds I knew I had to look further in the future and really think about what can be done today.

My plan includes accepting bitcoin for payments, embracing the idea that every company needs to be a media company first, have a strong online presence, and actually build a brand for the company. I will try to provide more to customers other than services/products.How so? Still trying to figure it out, if you have any ideas for me, throw them.

Anyone else got family members in crypto just because they trust your view?Anyone else with a business and is considering something similar?

If institutions have been driving this bull run then will there even be an alt season like in 2017-18?

The reason for the previous alt season was due to retail investors and FOMO in my opinion

Will institutions be that interested in the alt coins? They are investing in Bitcoin to hedge against upcoming inflation due to quantative easing during the pandemic

They are probably going to be interested in ‘early adoption of new technology’ or however you want to shill your alt coin. If they were they would have taken on Bitcoin earlier

Bitcoin is a censorship resistant decentralized global currency outside of the control of corporations, governments or any individual or hostile actors.

It is the only crypto that had a truly fair distribution of coins. No premine, 2 month notice before launch, and slowly rolled out over several years. Users who supported the network were rewarded with Bitcoin at a time when it was worthless. This can never be replicated again.

Because Bitcoin is truly decentralized the rules cannot be changed. There will only ever be 21,000,000 coins total and the inflation rate for Bitcoins entire life is set in stone. The rules have been set permanently. This is important for SoV because you know someone in the future can't change something to devalue your share.

Bitcoin is also the most secure. It has been attacked and battle tested for 12 years, and is proof that it is secure to handle the large market-cap being a SoV causes it to be. It has the most infrastructure built around it and the highest hash rate securing it.

WeNano feels like the equivalent of bending over to pick up change on the street. If you are the kind of person that would pick up a nickel, then you should get WeNano. Sadly, even in the time I have had the app, the rewards in the larger spots had dropped quite a bit as more people have started using the app. It only takes a few second to click on a spot each day and get your free currency, so it is not a time sink at all. 

I like TipNano more than Quicrypto, but it doesn't award Bitcoin. I like the faucet within the app. I currently have over 2 Nano in the app to redeem, mostly from playing mobile games. However, the games do not seem to update often, if at all, and the diminishing returns means the app will likely outlive its usefulness unless I decide to focus on surveys. The surveys and games give a *lot* more Nano than the faucet. 

On a tangent, Nano has been a bit unreliable lately with the spam attacks or whatever going on, so withdrawals have been delayed, but I haven't really followed those developments closely. So Quicrypto may be the better option if you want to just use Bitcoin instead. 

The Bling games *might* be worthwhile if Bitcoin continues to get more valuable. I do not think the amount you get right now is really worth the time.

What is the point when 3 months of salary cannot even pay for transaction fees, you’ll lose out more investing in bitcoin rather than buying 1 USD paper notes. Heck have you ever considered that some of these guys don’t even have access to stable internet access.

Also about the inflation, even with those increasing money supply US will not go through hyper inflation.

t3_mf7po5,"**What is bitcoin dominance?**

[Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) is bitcoin's marketcap dividend by the marketcaps of all cryptocurrencies combined. It shows how much value bitcoin has versus the all cryptos combined. This is important because it shows the relative strength of altcoins over time. For most of bitcoin's lifetime (pre-2017), dominance sat at over 98%. Bitcoin was the entire market. But since the first altcoin boom in 2017, it has never come close to that peak again.

**Why did it happen?**

There are a few reasons why bitcoin value relative to the rest of the crypto market fell so dramatically in 2017. One major reason was the bitcoin cash fork that occurred in July 2017. Bitcoin cash gained momentum throughout late as the ""true"" bitcoin because of miner support while bitcoin was suffering from network congestion and high fees. There were calls that ""the flippening"" was going to occur in early 2018 and there would be a mass exodus of bitcoin supporters moving to bitcoin cash. This never ended up happening and bitcoin cash rapidly fell off after this point. 

Another reason was that other established altcoins at the time like eth, litecoin, dash and monero had huge rallies and hit their all time highs versus bitcoin. While they are similar prices today against the USD, they are still well off their all time highs vs. bitcoin.

The third reason was the first ICO boom. Hundreds of new ICOs hit the market from late 2017 and early 2018. Today we are seeing a similar boom of new ICOs and shitcoins hitting the market.

**What does this mean?**

Bitcoin dominance sitting at 65% means that alt season could run for quite a bit longer. If we see another nosedive of bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance going back below 50% would mean that altcoin values would have gained hundreds of billions in value. While the altcoin market has absolutely surged over 2021, its still far from its all time highs in early 2018. I think the altcoin market will continue to boom.",litecoin,
t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it. One guy cant decide that an update is happening. The miners must accept it.",litecoin,

[Session 6 Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m60zkf/taking_genslers_blockchain_and_money_mit_course/?)

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues

t3_mfds1t,We have seen a lot of posts about Venezuelans using Crypto. Maybe we can send them some relieve using WeNano?,link,
t3_mfds1t,"EDIT:


For any of you BitcoinCash holders: [there's a project that uses BCH in Venezuela for this exact purpose](https://eatbch.org/venezuela/), so for anyone that wants to donate using BCH you can do so with that link! The EatBCH project is one run by Venezuelans and uses these donations to buy meals for the locals. They have already provided thousands of meals and every penny helps!

EatBCH also operates in South Sudan through a different team, so if you want you can donate to them as well through the same website. Link: https://eatbch.org/south-sudan/
_______


I'm not a Nano shill and don't own any as an investment, but can't we all chip in and use WeNano to make spots in Venezuela and donate crypto to locals?

Venezuelans are going through a very rough time and due to inflation their minimum wage is currently only 1 USD *a month* and a family needs roughly 300 USD a month to survive. Due to the extreme inflation a lot of Venezuelans have already turned to crypto, so we could reach a lot of people with this. If we can chip in even a couple of bucks we can really help people who need every penny to survive. 

You can donate a certain amount to the spots you pick or make, pick the radius up to 10km so an entire city can access it, and locals in that spot can only take the limited amount that you set (so nobody can just snatch thousands) which can be a couple of bucks or more. There's a minimum of 0.1 Nano per spot so that's about $0.45 and that's enough to help!

We have all been lucky to see some amazing gains over the past months, so maybe it's time to give something back. If the people over at WallStreetBets can donate to worthy causes than so can/should we!

I'm not really that experienced with WeNano and have only just started using the app, so maybe someone else can do a write up in the comments on how to use it, so for the time being [here's a video explaining how it works](https://youtu.be/T5UKQksjVlE). You can download the app on your phone via the playstore/appstore, but with all the scammy apps on there I'd advise you to follow the links via their official website: https://wenano.net/

(Please point out if I'm wrong about any of this. I have only just downloaded WeNano for this purpose so I'm pretty new as well)

Tether just minted a very significant amount of new coins. 

What are your thoughts on this considering the allegations against them? I consider this a big deal and am unsure why no one is talking about this.

This at least deserves a conversation. For those unaware Tether has been accused of minting new coins without having the fiat to back it. FUD?

Next session: Public Policy",link,
t3_mexb51,DeFi explained: NFTs,link,
t3_mexb51,"What are NFTs? And what can you do with them? In this post I’ll try to answer these questions.

# What is an NFT?

If you want to understand the concept of NFT, you must first know what a Fungible token is. NFT stands for Non-Fungible token. An important property of a fungible token or “normal” token is that they are interchangeable - You can exchange bitcoins with each other, the value is equally divisible for everyone - bitcoins can be divided into parts and you can exchange them. For example: 0.003240000 BTC.

An important difference with the Fungible tokens is that the NFTs have a unique aspect and cannot be replicated. This unique aspect is encoded in the token's metadata. Think of it as a certificate of authenticity.

## Some features of NFTs:

* They are unique, this allows you to identify items with them.
* They are not divisible.

The latter has the advantage that you can only claim right to a certain product, service or other object such as an art object. Compared to a real-life example; a football ticket for the match is for one person. You cannot share this ticket with multiple people. There is one seat available for you in the grandstand.

## What can you do with NFTs?

The NFTs have already entered the gaming industry. However, there are plenty of applications to come up with in other situations as well. Think of; birth certificate, diploma, or ID. All these unique items can be ""tokenized"". Tokenizen is digitizing a certain asset and linking it to the blockchain, such as art.

## NFTs vs normal tokens

Another difference between normal tokens and NFTs is the protocol they run on. The normal tokens run on the Ethereum protocol: ERC-20.

For Non-fungible tokens there is a choice of two protocols: ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Of which ERC-721 is the most used. ERC-1155 is slightly newer and less used.

The ERC-1155 protocol has been developed to enable developers to implement this protocol in a smart contract in a smart and efficient way. This can then be used to generate unlimited fungible (identical) tokens and non-fungible (unique) tokens.

The ERC-721 protocol, on the other hand, is used to generate non-exchangeable tokens, forcing developers to implement a new smart contract for each new token.

## Non-fungible tokens and gaming: Crypto Kitties

A well-known example using ERC-721 tokens is Crypto Kitties. Each ERC-721 token in that game is a unique digital cat.

You can breed these with the help of another digital cat and create new cats. The new cats can then be bought and sold on the platform.

## Decentraland

Another good example of a platform that utilizes NFT's is Decentraland. The name already gives it away: it is a (virtual) world that is completely ""built"" on blockchain. It can be compared to Simcity: you buy a virtual piece of land, on which you can build and develop whatever you want. Nobody decides what you can build, you are completely free. In addition to buying virtual land, you can also trade other unique assets with other players in the form of NFTs.

## Ethernity chain

Ethernity Chain, a new player to the game, is developing a community-centric platform for digital artists to create limited edition NFT lines. Ethernity Chain enables users to own unique digital artifacts and artwork, which are tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This is of particular appeal to the gaming, music and sports industries. However, the scope for NFTs is unprecedented. Ethernity Chain addresses this with the use of Authenticated non-fungible tokens (ANFTs).

## NFTs in the future: What can you expect from them

One development in which NFTs can play a major role is DeFi. Decentralized Finance. This topic has been growing in popularity in recent years. And the Non-Fungible tokens can play a supporting role in this.

Let's look at an example: a car accident. Two different parties. Two different insurance companies that have to sort everything out among themselves. They need to collect all data. This is a lot easier via the blockchain, because everything is linked. An NFT may contain data about an insurance policy or car. Link smart contracts to this, and you know: you don't have to think about anything yourself. The blockchain will solve it for you.

## Final words

In this post, you’ve learned that non-replaceable tokens are unique and have unique properties. This allows them to be associated with a specific item. In addition, items such as artwork, have different values ​​that make it interesting to use NFTs. Especially in the gaming industry, it is becoming more popular to use NFTs.

He linked me to some FOREX trading site and convinced me to sign up. So, I signed up as ""Michael Scott"". He told me he would mirror the same trades he makes himself on my account... I just need to link him to my account to get started.

Since I refuse to send my ID, he sends me to a new site. This site is even less legit than the first. I decide to upload he profile picture as my verification photo... and soon after he stops talking to me. Feels like I lost a friend.

This is just a reminder that if anyone has a bot or a trading strategy that produces ungodly returns, they are 99% likely to be a scam. If they can produce 25% returns weekly reliably, they don't need your business.

Update:

I've also reported the BTC address to the [Bitcoin Abuse site](https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/131sZ3uCJJtSUHW6dib3wBFPkZUtwPmaZK). Any time you are sending BTC to someone new, regardless of how legit your transaction may seem, I'd suggest checking the address on this site before sending.

t1_gsma9m9,"Keep learning about them, there are huge differences among cryptos.

Last year’s game changers IMO were link, aave, compound, maker, and uniswap. They enlarged the whole playing field. 

This year there is a lot of momentum behind blockchains like dot, ada, algo, tezos, cosmos, and even polygon helping ethereum. 

Gaming and media are getting bigger (enjin, theta, etc), nfts are still new (nif, lyxe), and then there’s the manufacturing industry (vet, mrph). 

Snx could be a game changer if it can steal more of the derivatives market, Agi with its AI potential, nano is still appealing, and there could be many little guys ready to step it up (moonswap, dragonchain). 

There’s obviously a crap ton more I didn’t mention but I hope this gives a good picture. The field is wide open with possibilities. I wouldn’t rule out any of these coins.",link,

t3_mf0b91,"Hi cryptoheads,

(Sorry I had to delete the post yesterday, got it approved from the mods this time)

As the number of subscribers approach 2m in this sub, I thought ill conduct an anonymous survey regarding our involvement in crypto-world. I thought it would be fun to see the what kind of different people make up this sub.

Please note, that none of the questions ask about the amount of crypto you hold. I have tried to keep the questions as neutral as possible, with almost every question having the option of “Prefer not to say”, in case anyone of you feels uncomfortable answering any question. Before anyone starts making jokes about me being IRS, let me clarify that I am just a normal person who is conducting this survey for educational/entertainment purposes.

I have tried to keep the survey simple and quick. It has around 20 questions and takes a maximum of 5 minutes.

Here is the link: [https://forms.gle/EDPqYmeAPrmcueocA](https://forms.gle/EDPqYmeAPrmcueocA)

I hope you people will fill out the survey as more people take the survey, more interesting the results will be.

t3_mf0eos,"Hello fellow frienditors, it’s me again. 

##*This List Will Contain Some Of The Basics Fundamentals From This Whole Subreddit.*

**UPDATED VERSION 2.0**

&gt;*As a celebration of averaging 2,200~ new subscribers daily, and soon beating the 2 million mark, I thought that it will be a good idea to provide here, some useful posts based on this community contributors.
Thanks to the more and more useful posts flooding this subreddit, I thought that it would be a great idea, to gather some more useful posts, and to share them with you in this list.
I wanted to update the first original post, but I thought that it will not get so much attention for beginners. Not everyone knows how to use the search bar. Bear in mind, that it’s pretty hard to track every useful and helpful posts at this subreddit, that’s why I will accept and appreciate any particular suggestions to what to edit in this post. I am not taking any credits, everything belongs to the original posters of these post. I only collected them for your own good.*

**You don’t have to award me, it’s better to go and thank the OPs of these posts. Go forth and award them for their contributing!**

From what I’ve read and seen here during my actuation, I’ve managed to dig deeper into the waters of this subreddit, so I can highlight you the most efficient and basic ones. I decided to make a decent comprehensive list about the most asked and frequently asked questions in this subreddit. I suggest you to use this list as a “*brain in your pocket*”. You can save this list and come back to it whenever you need to.

I’ve managed to dig deeper into deep waters to collect as many helpful resources  and threads as was possible that were posted here and got a decent positive responses, so you don’t have to waste your time finding them. I’ve collected a decent amount of all the frequently asked things in hundreds of posts but I will try to keep  it simple and share here only ( *in my opinion* ) the most efficient ones. 

Bear in mind, that these topics can be outdated already and can vary in some aspects. It’s not sure that they are 100% accurate at present, but I will try to pick the best pieces.

At the end of every topic, after my short introduction to these essentials in this thread, there will be very decent, helpful, informational, deeper links to posts that are describing the talking threads in depth. 


###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###DYOR - Do Your Own Research

**DYOR**. Yep, you probably saw this acronym many times in this subreddit. In short, “*DYOR*” (not Christian) means that you should never, never and never trust an any other company, people, project team or anyone else without proper verifying of the information that they provided for you. Always compare their suggests to your **OWN RESEARCHES**.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

##NOTE TO ALL :
**This Comprehensive List Of All The Basic Useful Threads** should only be used for an educational purposes **ONLY**. I am not forcing anyone to listen, read and use these posts for your present and future investments. In my opinion we should learn from them. Otherwise, use this list as a white paper/ starting point on your journey, not as your “get rich quick scheme” or “business plan”.

t3_mey1y7,"This will be a boiled down argument for why you should stop checking your portfolio hourly, daily and even weekly - and what intense portfolio-looking does to you.

1. The biggest and easiest to explain factor is glaringly obvious when explained and it comes down to statistics. If you expect 100% gains during a 1 year investment, it will not go up all the time during those 525.600 minutes of the year. At best, it will be up from the last minute, maybe 10.000 times more than it will be down. Say you check bitcoins price every minute 51/100 times it will be up (this is even generous). This is important, because og the theory in psychology that states losses cause more hurt than gains reward in terms of happiness.

But if you check daily instead of per minute, you might be up 200/365 days. That’s significantly up from 51/100. Now if you check monthly, you might be up 8/12 og 9/12 months (from the last month) assuming a 100% expected yearly return. (This is a high apy, but still applies to a low one, but let’s be real, if ur in bitcoin you expect high returnand volatility)

If you are a holder believing in bitcoin, you’re better off checking as few times as possible since variances in prices on daily candles are insignificant compared to the long term, and what you are seeing is the outcome of randomness. When you factor in the psychology of loss and gain, your mental will lose every time when checking often. By checking the price monthly or twice monthly, what you see is bitcoins actual price movement and not the result of daytraders random results.

2. Becoming too invested in your investment. Dedicating your time to checking your portfolio also takes time away from other productive things (or even just watching tv). If you’re not planning on changing your investment, there’s no reason to be checking it often since no matter how many times you do so, it’s still going to be the same price in 1 month as if you didn’t check. Spend that time watching tv instead, it’s better than wasting time watching random outswings in price.

3. Being down from your ATH is frustrating. 
By checking bitcoins price often, you make sure you will be seeing the price being DOWN from the ATH 99% of the time. If you check it less, chances are you still won’t be seeing the ATH.. but instead of being 15% down from ATH you shift your focus to being up 10% since you checked last month.
This third reason could vary from person to person with it being insignificant to some people.


TL;DR:
By checking your portfolio often, you’re just checking the results of daytraders random outcome. Checking less often gives you a clearer indication of bitcoins actual price moment. 

Psychological principles say losses hurt more than wins gain - leaving your unconscious mood to be decided by daytraders is probably not in your interests when investing in bitcoin. 

Check less often for higher chance of being up from when you last checked to be affected less by random, insignificant price actions. This applies if you’re a bitcoin bull in a bull market.",bull,
t3_mfdfiw,Analyze: When the bull market ends? 4 indicators.,bull,
t3_mfdfiw,"  

**Short answer: Nobody knows! This is not financial advice.**

Long answer: Nobody knows, but there are some indications. Still not financial advice.

**1 / Market cycle duration**

First bitcoin cycle was around 15 months. Second one was 36 months. Third one was 48 months. So, you could conclude as market cap grows, each cycle becomes slower at accumulating more capital. So far, this cycle has been 26 months from the bottom. If the trend is going to continue, this cycle still has a lot to offer.

**2 / Market cap peak trendline**

If we draw the trendlines from previous cycles ([chart by Peter Brandt CEO of Factor LLC](https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-11.20.35-AM-775x446.png?format=webp)), it seems that we still have room before reaching the peak area. This trendline is based on very few data points, but if the market is going to behave the same way, it appears that we are in in the middle of the current cycle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbfijdSZAU) for more info. 

**3 / Ratio between long-term holders to short-term holders.**

In simple terms, in the last bull-markets short-term holders increased and long-term holders decreased to certain levels when we approached the end of market cycle. [In this chart](https://i.imgur.com/eGEwsHQ.png) you can see this ratio (and the [mathematics behind it](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/rhodl-ratio/)), going to red area indicates that we are near the end of cycle.

**4 / Stock to flow model**

For 'store of value' commodities there has been a useful model which has predicted the value of assets like gold and silver. Since bitcoin behaves similarly, it has been successful at predicting bitcoin too. Each time the real price deviated from the model; it went back to it. Right know we are very close to [the model’s prediction](https://i.imgur.com/Lpe3Kbz.png), which could indicate a rather “fair value”.

In the end, it has been always said “[all models are wrong, some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)”. Market is unpredictable, there is a big chance non of this happens. But if we are to guess, this bull market doesn't seem to be finished yet.",bull,

t1_gsmi5v1,"&gt;In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.

So the thing is, you're comparing a relatively brand new asset class in bitcoin which is about 10 years old, to a 5,000 year old asset class in gold. There are many reasons why the comparison you're drawing isn't a fair one. For starters, bitcoin is still in its infancy, or price discovery mode, over the course of the next 100 years at minimum. Once we've mined every last bitcoin and only then, would it be fair to draw a comparison to gold as a store of value, in the way you're doing it. 

Basically, people need to calm down with these comparisons and just let bitcoin do it's thing. This is sortof like comparing a high school Michael Jordan to a prime Magic Johnson. Give bitcoin the time it needs before you draw the comparisons.",bull,
t1_gsl5k5u,This is actually one of the reasons for the actual bull market,bull,
t1_gslc0dr,No one knows for certain if it will continue to grow after bull run.,bull,
t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",bull,
t1_gsna7nc,"To answer your question,

There are a few factors that stack against it:

1. The main reason: Ripple and XRP are nearly as old as Bitcoin, first being made in 2011-12. At the time, mining and proof of work consensus was THE way to manage the block chain and monetize network security. XRP (ripple credits at the time) come along and have pre-mined coins (100 billion). A pre-mined coin was the antithesis of what people felt the Block chain could/would/should be.

2. It was advertised to be a bankers coin, a coin that would bridge the gap between banks and the general population with speedy, secure, and cheap transaction. This was also an antithesis to blockchain as people saw banks as the bad guy and blockchain tech was there to shut them down.

3. The founders gifted themselves billions of xrp. However at the time of creation they gave themselves something worth literally nothing. It was about a year later that the coin went to .006 which equated their XRP to about 30 million. Now it's more for obvious reasons.

4. The negativity born in the early years has carried over as those with negative opinions parrot the message give to them from people who also have negative opinions about it. The cycle repeats itself over and over every bull cycle.",bull,
t3_mf5or1,"Unpopular Opinion. Bitcoin is a hypergrowth tech asset, and not necessarily a traditional recession-proof store of value, and we should be careful with the labels we put to it",bull,
t3_mf5or1,"First of all, before explaining why I believe this, I'll explain what I mean exactly by this.

In this sub, and everywhere in the crypto community, we keep hearing ""Bitcoin is a store of value"", ""Bitcoin is digital gold"" and similar things. According to Investopedia, a store of value is ""an asset that maintains its value, rather than depreciating"", and lists gold as an example. This does not necessarily mean that gold is a better investment than Bitcoin, in fact I believe the opposite, since its inception Bitcoin has been the asset with highest growth.

When we talk about a store of value, we tend to refer to some sort of asset that can provide a decrease in risk to your portfolio during turbulent times. We have very little data that could suggest that Bitcoin is recession-proof or an investment that you should make when your economy is going down, and in fact, most of the little data we have suggests the opposite.

Consider how gold behaved during the 2008 stock market crash. The Dow Jones dropped from 13k in April 28th 2008 to 6.6k in March 2nd 2009, in other words the stock market during that time period almost dropped 50%. In April 2008, gold was at \~1200, and in March 2009 if was at \~1100, with the lowest low reaching \~880 in October 2008, in other words, the price of gold dropped \~27%.

However, Bitcoin wasn't a thing during this time recession, and ever since then we have enjoyed the biggest bull market in American history, leading to all time highs, growth and returns in the tech sector. This was the time when Bitcoin was growing as well.

In fact, the only recession we have had since 2008 was the covid recession, and this is the little data we have about how Bitcoin behaves in a recession:

* Dow Jones dropped from 29.4k in February 10th 2020 to 19.2k in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 35% drop.
* Gold went from 1570 in February 11th 2020 to 1487 in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 6% drop.
* BTC dropped from 10.2k in February 11th 2020 to 5200 in March 17th 2020, a 49% drop.

In conclusion. While BTC has proven to be a great investment (and I will keep investing in it), so far there is no evidence that it will act against some sort of hedge against recessions or be a store of value. So far, the data we have is that it's behaving like a hypergrowth asset during the biggest bull market in history, but we should be careful suggesting people to buy BTC during times of uncertainty when they think the economy is going down, because there is no historical evidence that BTC will act as a hedge against a failing economy.",bull,

If institutions have been driving this bull run then will there even be an alt season like in 2017-18?

The reason for the previous alt season was due to retail investors and FOMO in my opinion

Will institutions be that interested in the alt coins? They are investing in Bitcoin to hedge against upcoming inflation due to quantative easing during the pandemic

###CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL

If you’re here, you probably should already know what is cryptocurrency. If not, then here is the short simple answer: **Cryptocurrency** is a digital currency that can be used to buy services or goods. It can be used as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are using strong ledger which is **securing** online transactions. This makes it literally nearly impossible, impenetrable to counterfeit. There are currently over 8.700~ cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.

###WALLETS

A wallet is a important thing to own when you’re working with cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet can be device, program or a service which is storing your **keys** or **seed**. These keys or seeds are being used to verify yours transactions in order to prevent someone else from using your cryptocurrencies. You can store in them your cryptocurrencies pretty much totally safely, or even your FIAT.

###EXCHANGES

Simply, Exchanges are Platforms. Platforms that we’re using every day to trade our cryptocurrencies for other assets, including either FIAT or digital currencies. They act as **intermediary** between the seller and the buyer. For this job, we’re paying them the transaction fees or commissions.

###Dollar Cost Average (DCA)

It is an investment strategy/technique in which an investor is spreading his crypto, stock or fund purchases. It’s a strategy where you’re buying at regular intervals ( weekly, monthly, every other week etc. ) with a roughly similar equal amounts of money. It aims to **reduce** the **volatility** and minimize **risk**.

**I would like to ask you kindly to suggest some more USEFUL** threads or links in the comment section below.

##NOTE TO ALL :
**This Comprehensive List Of All The Basic Useful Threads** should only be used for an educational purposes **ONLY**. I am not forcing anyone to listen, read and use these posts for your present and future investments. In my opinion we should learn from them. Otherwise, use this list as a white paper/ starting point on your journey, not as your “get rich quick scheme” or “business plan”.

t1_gsm3fn8,"I kind of agree with you. An asset with ten years of life with such an impressive volatility is not a reliable store of value.

A store of value is the gold, when it ""crashes"" it dips a 5%. Compared to cryptocurrencies, those actually are dips for ants.

In the recent story, it has only actually ""crashed"" once during the 2007 crisis, and it recovered quite fast. 

When it comes to cryptos though, it's not uncommon to see 10 and 15% dips or even more. During bear markets, we've seen -80% from ATH, which is kinda scary for a store of value.

You also make a great point, we haven't seen Bitcoin on a bear market yet. Bitcoin itself has been bearish multiple times, however, it has not lived yet a worldwide recession like the 2007 crisis. How would it behave? No one knows, and thus, it's quite hard to claim it being a store of value.",bear,

t1_gsmfqyv,"Haha same here, returned in January to find all my dust on binance turned into like $100. Bought back into btc, eth and vet mainly.

I dont think we are too late to still get a good return before the next bear market, and I certainly wont ignore those sweet deals next time.",bear,
t1_gsnk419,"yeah, and also people can do a lot of money not trading, just maybe staking maybe for half yea, or if you think the bull market will end sonner just for a couple of monthsr! I started staking back in december when i got my attention back into crypto... i think i will keep doing it even on the bear market, survive again, and on the next couple of years when we are back on the next bull market cycle, my % of btc, eth, dot, bnb and a few others will be up because of staking and not doing risky emotional trades.",bear,
t1_gsnc4n5,"Exactly this.

When btc dropped from 60k to 50k, was it the start of a crash? No, but only because it went back up. Did you sell? No. When would you sell? When you were sure it was a crash? Would that be at 45k? That could well be the bottom, then it goes back up. If you could know it was a crash early enough to sell it would be great, but you can't. 

My opinion on this..

1. Sell some on the way up. Take profits to the point you would be okay if it crashed (in fact, maybe you should be running this equation all the time in crypto). 

2. Hodl, and stop looking at the price, if you believe holders always win. They have so far, eventually fwiw. 

If you go with 1, you feel you messed up by taking profits when everyone said to hodl, if it goes up. It will seem obvious if it does you shouldn't have taken profits.

If you go with 2, you have to weather out the bear market, and it will seem obvious you should have sold. You had it all in your hands and you let it slip.

t1_gsnckn2,I'm curious how my modest doge holdings will survive the inevitable encounter with a bear,bear,
t1_gsmg2lq,It’s just a disinflationary asset that you can Trust will stay true to form.  That means over the long run it will go up significantly given more adoption.   Inflation hedge is a side effect that the media has taken as gospel and Bitcoiners are fine to let them.  If we had just started a major bear market in Jan 2020 we would not have seen events unfold anywhere close to the same way.  Noncorrelated.,bear,
t1_gsmtsj6,Hold and DCA as long as I still believe in it. The people that talk about 3 year bear market act as if everyone just sits there and do nothing while their investment declines. You DCA on the way back up.,bear,
t1_gsn7rmt,"Why is everybody convinced there's going to be another big bear market soon? A lot has changed since 2017, and the fact that bitcoin is not only still around, but is even stronger and getting lots of institutional support, should alleviate a lot of people's fears that this is all going to come tumbling down.",bear,
t1_gslohgc,"That it massively increased in price, in a similar fashion to TSLA for example, which also 10x'd after its dip from COVID, which is exactly my point. We have very little to no evidence of how Bitcoin would behave during a bear market, and because of this, what we can currently claim with certainty is that it is a great growth investment during bull markets, and that's it",bear,
t1_gslgihr,"Yes, but since the bear came and killed the bull not many people wanted to watch it since bitcoin died for the xth time",bear,
t1_gskkl6b,"Good job, reminding everyone that loss and gin have an asymmetrical  influence on decisions. But I would advise not checking only during bull run to stay calm.

But all in all. No regerts",bear,
t1_gslkn7q,"People need to read and educate themselves to make more money and really take DeFi into the next level. Trends can be foreseen if you read daily articles and make your analysis, people are just lazy. As a certified trader I tell you that people can really do it if they put some time into it. 

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really. There aren’t any other competitors in the blockchain supply chain niche.

Conclusion: You can’t predict the price, but you can study and learn more about what goes into the price changes from the projects, and make your decisions based on your research.",bnb,
t1_gsm8sv8,"FEG. It’s relatively new and has yet to be around for years but it changes the defi game with frictionless rewards. Taxing each FEG transaction 2%. 1% of the transaction is distributed to holders as more FEG tokens and another 1% is sent to a burn wallet. Deflating the supply of coins constantly and rewarding holders for holding. One sided liquidity pools on the brand new exchange, and the ability to stake the token for .1% of each transaction on the exchange in ETH or BNB as well as another 1% for every FEG token transaction in ETH or BNB as well.",bnb,
t1_gsmrqkk,"BNB is never getting delisted... the coin is in no way shape or form tied to a company profit. It is a coin used to make transactions on the BSC, which is the foundational network of PancakeSwap exchange. In fact, BNB is probably one of the best launchpad platforms out there... just look at what they did with Alice. People don't invest in BNB because Binance is doing well... they buy it because it gives you 25% discount on your trading fees and because BSC is a great freaking network with awesome projects that you can use BNB to invest with.

XMR, definitely is a possibility but in all honesty I think that it will become the Enigma machine of the underground world.",bnb,
t3_mfctan,What coins have a real risk of being delisted/banned from exchanges (like XRP was)?,bnb,
t3_mfctan,"Around 2017-2018, some of my friends have put everything into Ripple (yeah...). They didn't sell but contrary to most other coins, XRP hasn't recovered yet. I am not personally invested in XRP but from what I've heard, this was caused by XRP being delisted/banned on exchanges.

I was wondering what other coins have a well known risk like that? Personally, I have read about 2 coins in particular, XMR and BNB. 

XMR because of the privacy aspect of it and BNB because the coin is tied to the company profit and that would somehow violate some law. Both reasons invoked seem very weak/unclear to me. I have read about that via random comments this sub so this is by no mean solid info, which is what I'm looking for with this post.

So do these rumors have any basis and are there any top50 coins I should watch out for the same reasons?

t1_gsne6d2,"So now you have 100% on your hard wallet??

I have some at Binance and suffer the same, sometimes they have issues and balances show 0, or cannot enter because overloaded, etc... But on the other part, if you have some alts the rewards from Staking are good, for example BNB im on 20% staking, ETH im on the 2.0 staking and now its near 8% (has been above 10% for a couple months), BTC on the other part its just 1.2% or something like that so its better to keep it on hard wallet. Im my opinion, as also a alt holder, better to do hard wallet + exchange, to get a extra bonus.

t1_gsn6cyj,"The problem is nobody is developing on BNB.  It's only use case is to pay fees on Binance, which is fine, but fucking $40B valuation for that is laughable at best.  Smart contracts were copy and pasted to BNB simply so CZ could pump the fuck out of it to noobs on twitter (which works very well actually, just ask Tron).

Ethereum is so godamn expensive because everyone wants to use it.  Sad people are getting scammed into thinking that BNB is an alternative to projects such as ETH, ADA, DOT, etc, that have actual use cases.

Also, keep in mind there are hundreds of coins that are dirt cheap to transact with (hell Nano is free and it has 1% of BNBs valuation).  It's because, while they are cheap, they have other trade-offs such as scalability, security, or in BNB's case: decentralization.  Meanwhile BTC is still chugging past a $1T valuation with $25 transaction fees.  You need to look at the big picture.",bnb,

t3_mf2gcl,"Did you ever find £10 in an old coat or wallet that you'd forgotten about? or gone digging behind the sofa cushions and pulled out some loose change?

Over the years I've been in crypto I've transacted on a number of exchanges, participated in a number of airdrops and other schemes and ended up with tiny amounts of crypto scattered here and there which were, at the time, not worth bothering with.

I went on a mission recently and hunted down all the dust amounts I could find and was surprised to find that it added up to around $180!

t1_gsnch74,"The good versus evil conflict you are making Charles and Vitalik’s issues to be doesn’t exist. Doesn’t mean I condone Charles’ past behavior, but it doesn’t make him money hungry, and here’s why:

Charles wants to leverage the blockchain as an engine of trust between governments, business and people to upend the current world order. While Vitalik wanted a counter-culture/non-profit solution with smart contracts. Two very different visions. 

If all Charles is, is a “money hungry used car salesman” why is Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake model after Cardano proved it was possible? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The proof-of-stake model is a massive contribution to the crypto space. And whether you like Charles or not, this alone ensures that the man is more than a “used car salesman”.

Also, why did Charles institute a peer review process to allow some the world’s best minds to criticize the solutions that Cardano came up with prior to coding them? No one else in the crypto space does that. Why not take the short road instead and come out with smart contracts right off the bat instead of following a peer review process which will take longer(though it’s not as long in computer science compared to the other fields)? A peer review process also puts your solutions in front of the smartest minds in the world. Not something a charlatan would do. According to Charles, one of his conflict with Vitalik was about instituting a peer review process for Ethereum. Charles indeed instituted a peer review process for Cardano.

Charles has gone so far even to consider which programming language can ensure his vision. He picked Haskell, a high assurance language used for defense systems, trains and other systems where any error has massive negative consequences. Charles is certainly not a man who does things half-assed.

Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. That’s why Ethereum’s updates are reactive-fixing what is broken. And a massive architecture re-write like ETH 2.0 is necessary. In other words, Vitalik made major mistakes with Ethereum’s architecture which is now having an adverse of effect Ethereum’s scalability. Someone being an asshole to Vitalik doesn’t make him right, or “good”. 

Vitalik got what he wanted with Ethereum and Charles got what he wanted with Cardano. The good vs. evil battle that you are making this out to be is an exaggeration that comes from you “picking a side”.",bat,

t3_mexb51,DeFi explained: NFTs,decentraland,
t3_mexb51,"What are NFTs? And what can you do with them? In this post I’ll try to answer these questions.

# What is an NFT?

If you want to understand the concept of NFT, you must first know what a Fungible token is. NFT stands for Non-Fungible token. An important property of a fungible token or “normal” token is that they are interchangeable - You can exchange bitcoins with each other, the value is equally divisible for everyone - bitcoins can be divided into parts and you can exchange them. For example: 0.003240000 BTC.

An important difference with the Fungible tokens is that the NFTs have a unique aspect and cannot be replicated. This unique aspect is encoded in the token's metadata. Think of it as a certificate of authenticity.

## Some features of NFTs:

* They are unique, this allows you to identify items with them.
* They are not divisible.

The latter has the advantage that you can only claim right to a certain product, service or other object such as an art object. Compared to a real-life example; a football ticket for the match is for one person. You cannot share this ticket with multiple people. There is one seat available for you in the grandstand.

## What can you do with NFTs?

The NFTs have already entered the gaming industry. However, there are plenty of applications to come up with in other situations as well. Think of; birth certificate, diploma, or ID. All these unique items can be ""tokenized"". Tokenizen is digitizing a certain asset and linking it to the blockchain, such as art.

## NFTs vs normal tokens

Another difference between normal tokens and NFTs is the protocol they run on. The normal tokens run on the Ethereum protocol: ERC-20.

For Non-fungible tokens there is a choice of two protocols: ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Of which ERC-721 is the most used. ERC-1155 is slightly newer and less used.

The ERC-1155 protocol has been developed to enable developers to implement this protocol in a smart contract in a smart and efficient way. This can then be used to generate unlimited fungible (identical) tokens and non-fungible (unique) tokens.

The ERC-721 protocol, on the other hand, is used to generate non-exchangeable tokens, forcing developers to implement a new smart contract for each new token.

## Non-fungible tokens and gaming: Crypto Kitties

A well-known example using ERC-721 tokens is Crypto Kitties. Each ERC-721 token in that game is a unique digital cat.

You can breed these with the help of another digital cat and create new cats. The new cats can then be bought and sold on the platform.

## Decentraland

Another good example of a platform that utilizes NFT's is Decentraland. The name already gives it away: it is a (virtual) world that is completely ""built"" on blockchain. It can be compared to Simcity: you buy a virtual piece of land, on which you can build and develop whatever you want. Nobody decides what you can build, you are completely free. In addition to buying virtual land, you can also trade other unique assets with other players in the form of NFTs.

## Ethernity chain

Ethernity Chain, a new player to the game, is developing a community-centric platform for digital artists to create limited edition NFT lines. Ethernity Chain enables users to own unique digital artifacts and artwork, which are tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This is of particular appeal to the gaming, music and sports industries. However, the scope for NFTs is unprecedented. Ethernity Chain addresses this with the use of Authenticated non-fungible tokens (ANFTs).

## NFTs in the future: What can you expect from them

One development in which NFTs can play a major role is DeFi. Decentralized Finance. This topic has been growing in popularity in recent years. And the Non-Fungible tokens can play a supporting role in this.

Let's look at an example: a car accident. Two different parties. Two different insurance companies that have to sort everything out among themselves. They need to collect all data. This is a lot easier via the blockchain, because everything is linked. An NFT may contain data about an insurance policy or car. Link smart contracts to this, and you know: you don't have to think about anything yourself. The blockchain will solve it for you.

## Final words

In this post, you’ve learned that non-replaceable tokens are unique and have unique properties. This allows them to be associated with a specific item. In addition, items such as artwork, have different values ​​that make it interesting to use NFTs. Especially in the gaming industry, it is becoming more popular to use NFTs.

t3_mfds1t,We have seen a lot of posts about Venezuelans using Crypto. Maybe we can send them some relieve using WeNano?,bch,
t3_mfds1t,"EDIT:


For any of you BitcoinCash holders: [there's a project that uses BCH in Venezuela for this exact purpose](https://eatbch.org/venezuela/), so for anyone that wants to donate using BCH you can do so with that link! The EatBCH project is one run by Venezuelans and uses these donations to buy meals for the locals. They have already provided thousands of meals and every penny helps!

EatBCH also operates in South Sudan through a different team, so if you want you can donate to them as well through the same website. Link: https://eatbch.org/south-sudan/
_______


I'm not a Nano shill and don't own any as an investment, but can't we all chip in and use WeNano to make spots in Venezuela and donate crypto to locals?

Venezuelans are going through a very rough time and due to inflation their minimum wage is currently only 1 USD *a month* and a family needs roughly 300 USD a month to survive. Due to the extreme inflation a lot of Venezuelans have already turned to crypto, so we could reach a lot of people with this. If we can chip in even a couple of bucks we can really help people who need every penny to survive. 

You can donate a certain amount to the spots you pick or make, pick the radius up to 10km so an entire city can access it, and locals in that spot can only take the limited amount that you set (so nobody can just snatch thousands) which can be a couple of bucks or more. There's a minimum of 0.1 Nano per spot so that's about $0.45 and that's enough to help!

We have all been lucky to see some amazing gains over the past months, so maybe it's time to give something back. If the people over at WallStreetBets can donate to worthy causes than so can/should we!

I'm not really that experienced with WeNano and have only just started using the app, so maybe someone else can do a write up in the comments on how to use it, so for the time being [here's a video explaining how it works](https://youtu.be/T5UKQksjVlE). You can download the app on your phone via the playstore/appstore, but with all the scammy apps on there I'd advise you to follow the links via their official website: https://wenano.net/

(Please point out if I'm wrong about any of this. I have only just downloaded WeNano for this purpose so I'm pretty new as well)

BTC is probably the backbone of many portfolios here, hence is no joke when you choose to stop plain hodling into your cold storage and put your crypto at work producing more crypto: if you decided to get away from the *not your keys, not your coin* golden rule you have to put into serious consideration the benefits and risks. That quote is one of the best pieces of advice, but no dogma.

My personal experience, so far, has been with **BlockFi**, which granted me a 6% APY on BTC (tier1, from 0 to 1 BTC [the rates will change from the 1st of April](https://blockfi.com/our-btc-and-eth-rates-are-changing-and-heres-why)). I chose it for the emphasis on security, for being straightforward: no need to lock or to hold a platform coin, and for the possibility of letting me choose the cryptocurrency in which I could receive interest payments (which allowed me to mainly switch from BTC to ETH payouts when the circumstances were favorable or I wanted to rebalance my portfolio).

But this is not a BlockFi post, on the contrary, as I wrote earlier, Tier2 rates have been changed and heavily penalized. Other interesting possibilities I can find in the CeFi environment are **Nexo** (probably the most interesting, we start at 6% at the base loyalty level, but only if you choose to receive payouts in NEXO tokens, otherwise it's 4%), **Celsius** (5,10% if you choose the payout in CEL, otherwise in-kind reward rate is 4,06% APY - edit: US rates are different and provide a compelling 6,2% till 2 btc and 4,06% after) and **Crypto.com**, which are recently doing some interesting steps forward, between the 70 Billion CRO burned last month and the mainnet launched 3 days ago, aiming to decentralize the coin. In the latter, the APY can vary from 1,5% to 8,5% depending on the locked period and CRO staking.

On the DeFi side, you'll need to first tokenize your BTC, which will have to be converted in an erc-20 token before dedicating yourself to yield farming. wBTC and renBTC are examples of 1:1 BTC pegged tokens.

Some interesting options in the DeFi environment, can be found on **Curve** where, according to Coinmarketcap, the hBTC-wBTC pool grants a 7,62% APY, payout in CRV, with low impermanent loss: Another option is the **Harvest Finance** wBTC vault, with a lofty APY of 17,91%, payout in FARM and CRV, and still low IL, but at the same time a higher risk profile ( it's worth noticing that this DeFi protocol was hacked last October 2020 with 24M stolen).

This is a very fast overview, coming from my personal experience and research, with the risk/reward ratio to be always kept in mind. However, my main goal here is to open a discussion about your experience on BTC yield farming and CeFi/DeFi tools, being the brainstorming coming from this community always helpful. Personally, once I will feel more comfortable with DeFi, I will opt for decentralized protocols, being decentralization the reason why crypto is crypto.

Edit: check also the **Badger.finance**, a decentralized organization/community driven project (DAO), focused on BTC farming, with its BADGER token and two products: Sett (vault, DeFi aggregator with flash loans mitigation measures) and DIGG (non custodial synthetic BTC). The yelds look quite attractive.",crv,

Store your crypto safe and be paranoid!""",hot,
t1_gsmw9dx,im definitely one of those “not your keys not your coin folks” but must admit you have a good point. though one could also say that hackers will probably put lot more effort into trying to hack that 100b tech company vs. trying to get hold of my few bucks 🤔 still especially with the longer the more ways to actually use and spend crypto I do face myself with an increasing amount of it on hot wallets and exchanges so guess it’s a matter of balance a.I. amounts one feels comfortable with leaving/storing in certain places,hot,
t1_gsm26od,"Take a longer term view.  Make a plan and stick to your plan.  Don't be reactive to the day to day events.  Expect volatility and understand that it can lead you psychologically to make the wrong decisions (e.g., panic selling on dips, panic buying at sharp rises).  Remember that the most successful crypto investors are the dead ones.   Reacting daily, particularly when you're new, is probably a losing strategy.  When you're making a purchase, you should have an idea of if and when you would take profits and how much.  You should also have an idea what you would do if it falls.

Understand and think about your risk tolerance and tailor your plan around it.  Yes, a tiny market cap coin nobody ever heard of has a better chance of going 100x in a single day than the largest market cap coins, but it also has a better chance of dropping to nothing in a day.  Don't put money in that you cannot afford to lose.  Research the coins you're buying.  Trust your (researched) judgment over people you find on the internet.  Understand that when you're hearing a ""crypto celebrity"" on the internet tell you to buy a coin, it's entirely possible it's so they can dump it.

Don't believe anybody who claims they can make precise price predictions over the short term.  Instead, consider dollar cost averaging (DCA).  Take your time and make decisions that you can stand behind.  Don't feel that you need to race into this or you'll miss out (FOMO).

Research and take appropriate security precautions for how you store your crypto.  If you're getting into substantial amounts, don't leave your crypto on an exchange indefinitely.  Make sure you using multi-factored authentication for services you're using that provide it.  Use strong passwords and don't use the same password for different services.  Consider the use of a cold wallet.  Also make a plan for what happens with your crypto if something happens to you.    If someone messages you directly from reddit, there's a good chance it's because they want to try to scam you.  If you're using a hot wallet, be aware there are ""fake"" versions of them sometimes on the app stores.  Make sure you're downloading the official version.  When you're transferring crypto, do it very carefully--i.e., be careful not to transfer from a wallet with one type of coin to a wallet with another type of coin (e.g., from bitcoin to bitcoin cash).  Consider using ""allow-listing"" when using exchanges: i.e., set up the wallets you'd be moving crypto to and restricting transactions to those.  If you are using allow-listing, consider moving a smaller transaction before moving a large amount (yes, you'll lose a little to fees with that method, but it's better than losing your whole stack).  Be careful talking about crypto with friends and family.  Consider the merits of, just, not telling people.

Finally, participate in the /r/cryptocurrency (as you already are).  It's a good time. ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)",hot,
t1_gsmdie7,"Too western-centric point of view in my opinion. BTC is serving as real hedge against inflation and proving to be a store of value in crumbling south american economies like for example Venezuela and Argentina and certain african countires like Nigeria. What you really ought to be saying is, the data of how BTC behaves in (truly) crumbling economies is there. We just seem to value BTC diffrently in western economies and it tends to rise with other speculative assets against leading western currencies like the USD.

This is reckless speculation, but if I’m an institutional investor or decision maker dipping my toes into crypto, the 30-year MIT prof. with a Turing Award is number one on my list of people to get a meeting with.

The project was just launched four years ago and mainnet was just launched in 2019. This is why it isn’t as high as other projects yet. The transaction fees are measured in the thousandths and are instant. There are already millions of NFTs for these copyrights on the chain. 

The market cap is 1/10 of Cardano and it’s delivering value today, not just being hyped. I say this as a fan of Cardano and Charles. There is absolutely no logical reason for Algorand to be lower than Cardano, let alone 10% of the cap. If there is then someone please clue me in.

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 7: Technical Challenges**

* Gensler thinks governance is most challenging piece
* **Types of challenges:** time/latency, performance/scalability, how to handle micropayments relative to fees and costs of network, privacy/security and natural public policy tension between commercial and regulatory, should there be a ""right to be forgotten"" on a blockchain (like GDPR)?, interoperability, governance, collective action, commercial use cases
* **Options for improved performance/scalability:** Layer 2, side chains, sharding
* If you're not running a full node you're putting some trust in an authority with your private keys
* **Coase:** framework for comparing costs and trade offs, centralized costs = capture, economic rents (ability to collect excess profits), single point of failure, resiliency concerns, decentralized costs = coordination, governance, security, scalability...useful when analyzing use cases
* Many privacy coins are forked off of major coins, Bitcoin core code is available and proven so others build off that ""for free""
* Gensler believes performance and privacy challenges are more fixable, governance and collective action are harder
* **Vitalik Buterin Trilemma:** scalability; decentralization; security, can't get all 3, Gensler is more optimistic than Vitalik on this
* Trust issue around Bitcoin code
* **Bitcoin throughput:** 7-10 transactions per second
* **Ethereum throughput:** 20 transactions per second
* Example of an ICO with 40,000 to 50,000 transactions taking up a third of the Ethereum network that day
* **Visa throughput:** 24,000 per second
* **DTCC throughput:** SEC requires 100,000 per second capability
* **Proof of work energy consumption:** Digiconomist estimates 200 million Kwh/day, same electricity consumption of 6.8 million US homes, 0.33% of the world, equal to all of Austria...US financial system is 7.5% of our economy and costs in the trillions
* **Side chain/Layer 2/sharding/payment channel alternatives:** not new ideas, existing already in some form in finance, commercial banks are like side chains to central banks (net settling, digital reserves)
* **Side chain:** is the transaction valid? is the block valid?
* **Main chain:** is the chain valid? low latency, more secure, mining costs up
* **Lightning Network:** blockchain settlement when payment channel closes, bilateral network
* **Miner and mining pool operator economics:** impacts preference for big vs. small blocks, part of the reason behind Bitcoin Cash (2.5 minute processing time)
* Bigger blocks --&gt; fewer miners that can handle them --&gt; more centralization --&gt; less secure and more economic rents (every centralized system can collect economic rents)
* Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through network, more potential for accidental forks
* Side chains are recorded net (not gross), net settle to the main chain, loose form of escrowing written into scripting code
* Alternative consensus protocols deal with scalability 
* **Casper:** Ethereum project to get to proof of stake
* **Privacy and security:** contradictory tensions of pseudonymous addresses (law enforcement and regulators want transparency, financial institutions/some regulators/some users want less public transparency)
* **Concerns about privacy coins and mechanisms fostering illicit activities:** Dash, Monero, Zcash, mixer or tumbler mechanisms, this is where regulators get worried
* **Zcash:** zero knowledge proof for privacy
* **Gensler's ""buckets"" of illicit activities:** going outside the tax ""envelope"" (shrinking tax base), facilitating otherwise illegal activity (drug running, terrorism, child slavery) or money laundering, some countries might also view getting around capital controls (maintaining value of fiat) as illicit activity
* **Cybersecurity challenges:** private key custody/generation/storage, hacks, mismanagement, thefts, how does an institutional custodian secure keys (asymmetric risk)? not easy backdoors like recovering a password
* **Possible solutions:** zero knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments, cryptographic primitives that let someone prove a statement is true without revealing exactly why that statement is true (zero knowledge proofs) and commit to data (like a hash) but also combine (add and subtract) commitments (Pedersen commitments), Gensler believes regulators and finance can find a balance
* **Interoperability:** linking blockchain application to legacy databases, infrastructures, and technologies, or linking them to each other, or linking between main chain and Layer 2/side chains (easier), banking has had this all the time, raises costs of trust in coordinating transfer of assets and information into the blockchain or across chains, lots more work needed
* **Potential interoperability solution:** decentralized mechanisms (side chains or ""Layer 0"") for data transfers across chains
* **Consensus required for certain software updates:** open source updates which are not backward compatible (older versions won't validate all new blocks), leads to hard forks when block size gets bigger
* If a forked chain atrophies, commercial value might go to 0
* **Collective action and governance:** value from the participation of multiple parties in a network, adoption requires collective action, need to get people to use it to create value, early adopters can start network effects but path to incremental adoption isn't often clear, governance of blockchain software updates (how centralized is that governance?), permissioned blockchains have less of these issues

t1_gsnp5qu,"This is not euphoric. But along this thinking your right. Around August after ETH drops its upgrades and ada is up and running....when the charts are green for a week.... that euphoria that you just can’t lose kicks in. 

Stop your emotions take some profits, and keep some small moon bags.",ada,
t3_mewxqj,Serious question: Can I sue Voyager or report to the SEC?,ada,
t3_mewxqj,"So, I’ve had about a month to think about this, and I don’t know what to do. 

I typically use Coinbase pro, but wanted to buy ADA and DOT, so I downloaded voyager. I bought these along with a few other coins. In total, without getting too specific, I spent between 3 and 5 thousand dollars.

I used the app for about 3 months, everything seemed to be going well. I really liked the UX of the app, actually. 

One day, I went to check my coins and I was logged off. Usually, it took my Face ID or a passcode to get in to my Home Screen. No big deal, I thought. I keep meticulous records of all my login names/emails, passwords, and recovery codes. 

I typed in my email and password which was accepted then I was sent to the 2fa screen. I opened my Authenticator app but My voyager rotating code of 6 digits wasn’t on there anymore. Weird. I went in to my records and found my recovery code and entered it. This was accepted as valid and a code appeared. 

Unfortunately, the codes did not match and I could not log in. From here, I tried everything under the sun to trouble shoot. I deleted the app and re downloaded it. I made sure my time zones were accurate, etc. 

I emailed customer support about a month ago at this point with no reply. They don’t have a phone number and they specifically state not to email more than once. 

I don’t know what to do. This is a significant amount of money for me. I have thousands of dollars worth of crypto that I can’t access. 

To me, this is unacceptable. From a technical standpoint, I’ve done nothing wrong. This is clearly a account glitch of some kind. I was attracted to crypto partly because I was tired of feeling fed up with banks. And now here I am. 

It’s one thing to make a stupid purchase or lose money in a volatile market, it’s another thing entirely to have a supposedly reputable exchange just take it. 

I’m angry and want access back (to send elsewhere of course, no way I would keep using their service now). I am absolutely willing to put in the time to sue in small claims court. Can I do this?

Does the SEC want to know since I won’t be able to file taxes on this now?",ada,
t1_gsncd2v,"&gt; Maybe you believe Vitalik’s route was better, but his route is what led ethereum to the sky high gas fees and the scaling issues it has to deal with now. 

Your other misinformation has already been addressed, so im picking this one.

First, Scaling.

The reason Eth has scaling issues is because it has all the DAPPs.

Where's ADA's DAPPs? You can say something scales well but with zero use cases vs most all of the use cases that is easy to say.

There's two awesome bitcoin alternatives you may consider investing in if you think ""scaling"" is all that matters. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. They do everything bitcoin does! Except it scales better!

Second is your gas fee. So first the gas fee is high because ethereum is expensive right now and that raised the price in USD, not eth. Price in Eth also went up due to people using Eth for it's intended use case, unlike ADA, which is purely speculation with zero DAPPs. 

Last, you cant just update Ethereum. There is an update to deal with gas prices, EIP-1559. The problem is, it must be accepted by the miners, who do not benefit from gas price reduction. last i heard theyre trying to sweeten the deal by making the equivalent of Ethereum halving date later in the future, but who knows if they'll still accept it. One guy cant decide that an update is happening. The miners must accept it.",ada,

t1_gslkn7q,"People need to read and educate themselves to make more money and really take DeFi into the next level. Trends can be foreseen if you read daily articles and make your analysis, people are just lazy. As a certified trader I tell you that people can really do it if they put some time into it. 

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really. There aren’t any other competitors in the blockchain supply chain niche.

t1_gsmu3ay,"I’ll just talk facts regarding D=0 Day for Cardano...

All blocks will be produced by independent stake pools after the current Epoch ends.  With roughly 70% of all ADA in circulation staked, this will make Cardano a very decentralized ecosystem.  There’s also over 2000 stake pools now all over the world.  I’m located in the US, but I actually delegate to pools in Ireland, England, and the US through 3 different wallets.

The price of this event should be baked in to the current price of ADA.  Long time holders have been watching the progress bar towards total block production by the Cardano Community.

Now my opinion...

The Cardano Community is invested into Cardano just like the Ethereum Community is invested into Ethereum.  There’s also many people invested in both.  I see a scenario where both are successful.  If this happens, all of crypto benefits.  The scenarios where one or both fail are actually very bad for the alt coin space as a whole.  The constant bashing of both projects only degrades cryptos as an investment.  You don’t see the suits on Wall Street constantly bashing competitors.  They know it serves no purpose and will not equal winning. What equals winning is beating the competition by making the best product, having the best service, reaching more and more of the population, and being professional as fuck when every one around you is on the playground. Amazon doesn’t bash Walmart.  Amazon improves.  Amazon researches.  And Amazon wins.  They only care about the competition insomuch as to how to stay one step ahead.  Walmart doesn’t say a damn word about Amazon.  They just improve and launch their own 2 day shipping.  Amazon responds by trying next day.

I’m all in ADA with only a scant amount of ETH at the moment but you know what...I’m not afraid to say it...

I hope Ethereum improves.  I hope they solve all of the problems the network has now and in the future.  It will make Cardano always push.  I hope both win.  I hope I win.  And, if you’re all in on Ethereum, I hope you win.",ada,

t1_gsmu85y,"SEC isn't asking to shut down Ripple either. What they want is for Ripple to disgorge(burn most likely) all its XRP. The worst case for Cardano would be that Charles and Co would have to do the same with their ADA.

You can use any statistical metric you want ADA vs ETH and you will never be able to argue it isn't overpriced wrt Ethereum based on facts alone.

Ethereum is so godamn expensive because everyone wants to use it.  Sad people are getting scammed into thinking that BNB is an alternative to projects such as ETH, ADA, DOT, etc, that have actual use cases.

Also, keep in mind there are hundreds of coins that are dirt cheap to transact with (hell Nano is free and it has 1% of BNBs valuation).  It's because, while they are cheap, they have other trade-offs such as scalability, security, or in BNB's case: decentralization.

* the contents of the protocol and Dapp updates, their likely impact on the ecosystem, and what they unlock for all other developers/teams working on things in the ecosystem
* when those protocol upgrades and Dapp updates are scheduled to be released
* the true (not manipulated) amount of activity taking place on the blockchain and how that breaks down
* the amount of activity taking place and value being transacted on the  various Dapps (or Dapp sector eg Defi, NFTs, gaming etc)

Recently, prior to CBPro adding ADA, I decided to set up a recurring buy using this same feature. Well, I just looked at my ""Buy History"" and saw this:

The top 4 orders are a single recurring order, which has fired twice the last two weeks. Weirdly, it fired twice the first time about 8 minutes apart. The second time it fired twice, about 10 minutes apart. What the fuck? 

The bottom three orders are all a previous weekly recurring buy that stopped due to Binance performing maintenance. Apparently, that stops recurring orders. So, I rescheduled it on the 21st, and it fired twice then, and twice again this week. It worked previously for a couple weeks without issue.

t3_mewxqj,Serious question: Can I sue Voyager or report to the SEC?,dot,
t3_mewxqj,"So, I’ve had about a month to think about this, and I don’t know what to do. 

I typically use Coinbase pro, but wanted to buy ADA and DOT, so I downloaded voyager. I bought these along with a few other coins. In total, without getting too specific, I spent between 3 and 5 thousand dollars.

I used the app for about 3 months, everything seemed to be going well. I really liked the UX of the app, actually. 

One day, I went to check my coins and I was logged off. Usually, it took my Face ID or a passcode to get in to my Home Screen. No big deal, I thought. I keep meticulous records of all my login names/emails, passwords, and recovery codes. 

I typed in my email and password which was accepted then I was sent to the 2fa screen. I opened my Authenticator app but My voyager rotating code of 6 digits wasn’t on there anymore. Weird. I went in to my records and found my recovery code and entered it. This was accepted as valid and a code appeared. 

Unfortunately, the codes did not match and I could not log in. From here, I tried everything under the sun to trouble shoot. I deleted the app and re downloaded it. I made sure my time zones were accurate, etc. 

I emailed customer support about a month ago at this point with no reply. They don’t have a phone number and they specifically state not to email more than once. 

I don’t know what to do. This is a significant amount of money for me. I have thousands of dollars worth of crypto that I can’t access. 

To me, this is unacceptable. From a technical standpoint, I’ve done nothing wrong. This is clearly a account glitch of some kind. I was attracted to crypto partly because I was tired of feeling fed up with banks. And now here I am. 

It’s one thing to make a stupid purchase or lose money in a volatile market, it’s another thing entirely to have a supposedly reputable exchange just take it. 

I’m angry and want access back (to send elsewhere of course, no way I would keep using their service now). I am absolutely willing to put in the time to sue in small claims court. Can I do this?

I was wondering what other coins have a well known risk like that? Personally, I have read about 2 coins in particular, XMR and BNB. 

XMR because of the privacy aspect of it and BNB because the coin is tied to the company profit and that would somehow violate some law. Both reasons invoked seem very weak/unclear to me.

The partnerships are real, but yes you can get lost in the xCurrent xVia xRapid shuffle (two of which do not rely on XRP whatsoever).

Yes, partners are incentivized to use XRP, but that's one of the main reasons they have XRP in escrow anyways (to pay themselves a bit and to pay customers to use it).

But primarily between Treasures and Planet, I roughly added it this week and has made about $12 just in my free time or boredom.

Also, have you tried the bitcoinaliens mobile faucets? They have the BCH and LTC that I have been slacking on recently but super easy and fast little payments that add up and pay automatically every week that you meet the minimum payout, on Tuesdays :)

Last year’s game changers IMO were link, aave, compound, maker, and uniswap. They enlarged the whole playing field.

Gaming and media are getting bigger (enjin, theta, etc), nfts are still new (nif, lyxe), and then there’s the manufacturing industry (vet, mrph). 

Snx could be a game changer if it can steal more of the derivatives market, Agi with its AI potential, nano is still appealing, and there could be many little guys ready to step it up (moonswap, dragonchain).

t1_gsm2ncb,"1. Learn about the Bitcoin halving. This is what causes the bull cycle, and also what causes price explosions across the entire cryptocurrency sphere.
2. View investing in cryptocurrency like investing in companies on the stock market. There's thousands of companies to invest in, all promising and or offering something. But which ones would you feel okay with putting your money in?
3. 2. So avoid meme coins &amp; gimmick-like coins. These come in and out of style, much like cultural trends but on a much shorter time span, and trying to guess the next big meme/gimmick coin is like trying to guess the next big Reddit post when it only has 1 like.
4. Average dollar cost in. Hold for the long term. By  this I mean prepare to hold until 1) you're satisfied with your profits, or 2) around 2024 - 2025, when the next bull cycle will occur. 
5. Avoid day trading your portfolio and jumping from one coin to the next. Day trading at face value seems like a great thing to get into, but a couple wrong moves and your profits can crash harder than Bitcoin did in 2017. But if you day trade anyway, a rule of thing is to only trade a maximum of 5% - 10% of your total investment. 
6. Remember that a lot of people fail to retain profits from cryptocurrency because they buy and sell, buy and sell. When something drops, they'll sell, and when something goes up, they'll buy. They get sucked into promises, hype and hope over certain coins that are actually pretty bad for educated investors. Take your time to find truly good projects.
7. Scammers come in many flavors. It's common for scammers to create a fake, replicate site of a real cryptocurrency's website. It's also common for scammers to offer fake support on Twitter. They will fake being from a support team, replying to comments made on the official cryptocurrency Twitter, to ""help"" you resolve problems you may be seeking solutions to. YouTube has an endless sea of giveaway scams. Remember, no legit giveaway will ever, ever ask you to send crypto to them, no matter how legit it seems. And also, Google Search sometimes will have scam websites show up in their advertisement links.

Just a few random pointers. Learn about using private wallets &amp; how to stay secure when using them (e.g. never screenshot your wallet pass phrases or store them digitally). Do not leave your cryptocurrency on exchanges too long, because some exchanges will not compensate you for hacked/compromised funds, some of them just close out of the blue, and if you get locked out of your account, exchanges are known to have horrible customer support such that it may involve great effort to regain access to your account should you get locked out.

As a rough rule of thumb, high market cap coins are less risky of an investment (think Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, Theta, etc), whereas lower cap coins are more risky (e.g., some coin ranked #200). In other words, the lower the market cap, the more potential rewards over time, but the more risk you're putting in because they're less established.",theta,

t1_gslkn7q,"People need to read and educate themselves to make more money and really take DeFi into the next level. Trends can be foreseen if you read daily articles and make your analysis, people are just lazy. As a certified trader I tell you that people can really do it if they put some time into it. 

Case 1: ADA outperformed last March 19, professional crypto traders knew it, why? you just had to read Cardano’s roadmap and see the technical changes and the date (protocol change) then you just drop your numbers. Just check this NASDAQ article: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-cardano-has-outperformed-so-impressively-2021-03-19

Case 2: BNB, outgrew from $44 in Jan 2021 to $270 right now. What happened? they have been announcing burns (to increase the price) since Jan 19. And second, their Binance Smart Chain has been launching utilitarian tokens like Chilliz, CAKE and VENUS, all of these need BNB. All of them growing like crazy. All of them in launching pools in Binance and staking in Uniswap and Pancakeswap, gaining marketplace. And these arent shitcoins. Chilliz is the basis for many european soccer teams with thousands of fans. CAKE just powers a lot of pancakeswap project and Venus is one of the biggest lending platforms.

Case 3, My favorite: VeChain. Growing at around 50% since January. Supply Chain with its own Blockchain, with its own token VeThor. Their clients announced in Dec 2020: Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault, etc. December price: 0.014, Price now: 0.090 and growing. What makes the difference? The group patented in late 2020 in the USA: applications for blockchain in supply chain and blockchain in IoT. Surprise? Not really. There aren’t any other competitors in the blockchain supply chain niche.

Sure, right now Venezuela is just fucked. Only way out is for them to overthrow the government but that won't happen. They are beyond help at this moment and that is sand and unfortunate.

The paper USD doesn't work because the US has just printed in the last 18 approximately 60% of all money ever created... let that sink in... we've printed more money in the last 18 months than we have in the last 250 years of this country existing. And we are planning another $3.5 TRILLION in printing again. Only thing I hope is that they actually raise the taxes because THAT is better than printing money.

So again, the only HEDGE against inflationary tactics is a decentralized economy not dependent on any one country... ie. Bitcoin, or any other similar currency.

t1_gsn9c0b,"Venezuela has 30+ gold mines, huge supplies of aluminum, bauxite, and iron ore. Also they have the largest supply of natural gas in the western hemisphere. Oil is NOT the only thing that Venezuela has. 

Also, the tar sands in Venezuelas Orinoco Belt are significantly less viscous and can be extracted using conventional means and not pure surface digging. Yes, there is additional step of separating the crude from the sand but the fact is that Venezuela's tar sands account for about 80% of their total supply. So even if you take the 1+ trillion barrels of crude in the sands, they still have about 200 billion barrels of regular crude they can export if they want to.

Venezuela also owns Citgo, so they have opportunities for significant profits if they chose to have them... but they don't want to.

Since 2019 the Maduro government has refused to step down, disputing the results from the legitimate elections. US sanctions were issued because of the increasing political rhetoric, civil liberties violations of the citizens, and refusal to acknowledge the results of the elections or even trying another election instead. 

So yeah, Venezuela has shit ton of options, they are members of OPEC, they can export more crude than any other OPEC country if the US allowed them to. But allowing them to do so would legitimize the abuse that Maduro, and Chavez before him, have inflicted on the people. The moment that Maduro steps down and legitimate democratic government is leading the country, Venezuela will be the most prosperous country in South America. But not until then.

And what happens when a person dies without selling their real estate, how will the property be transferred to the next of kin and how do you verify that they are who they say they are?

I was able to find two projects which are developing solutions to these.

1)A proposal for decentralized Inheritance smart-contract on the Cardano project catalyst website (a site where people can propose dapps and improvements to get be voted by the community for funding. It is basically a smart contract a person can opt into which will transfer the funds of the wallet to the wallet of who ever they decide and will be triggered if the wallet is 'inactive' for a specified time.

2)Atala Prism project on Cardano which aims to verify identity in a decentralized private way using DIDs. I don't know how it works but apparently you can  verify where this person is who they claim to be without knowing anything about them.

A combination of two projects like this and also maybe projects like chainlink can be used together for this I guess.

t3_mf1adv,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),bull,
t3_mf1adv,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).   

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.   

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

But good luck on deep cuts, I hear that if bang your toe against the wall it hurts less. I wouldn't know, but that is what I hear.",bull,
t1_gsl2b2n,"You're making assumptions on high risk, which I understand when looking only at diversification, fair enough (disregarding his 32x arguments even though it's the whole point).
You completely lost me at low rewards though. How can you look at a 50MC and say low rewards. BTC would be low risk ""low"" rewards when looking at the crypto game halfway through a bull market.
Small caps are the definition of 100x potential.",bull,
t1_gskxz1e,"So let's talk about that a bit.

Performance is relative. You don't gauge it against the overall market but against other similar coins as the initial asset... and how likely is this particular asset to outperform those. There are a shit ton of other low cap coins that have a ton of potential that can outperform SLT by a mile. 

So when compared to similar coins what makes this such a guaranteed bet? Not much.

Everyone is also assuming that 30x that it took it to get here is going to be the same thing in the future. You do understand that in order for this to become a 100x coin, it needs to only go 3.3x from here on out. So you're betting on this being a 100x coin from here? That would make it 3,000x coin overall... do you see how unrealistic that is? Finding a 100x coin is hard enough... yes sometimes it seems that they are all over the place but actually finding a 100x coin takes a bit of hard work, effort, and luck. Finding a 1,000x coin is an incredible rarity that it doesn't happen often... and these guys are assuming it will go 3,000x based on the previous logic... HOW? Like really, HOW? Past performance is no guarantee of future gains, and the whole premise here is the assumption that this will continue on like that.

Going all in means that there is an assumption that this is the one coin that will do better than all others. If it's not then why go ALL IN on it? 

So yes, it is a high risk when compared to the rest of the field, and very low reward when you take the same field into the calculation. I think it is much more likely you will find another coin that will go 100x from here than you will have STL go 100x from here. That makes it a high risk, low reward option. The fact that I can cast a really wide net and have 10-20 shitcoins that will all do well in the bull run and give me 30x on my investment through the alt season, but there will be one, two, three gems in that bunch that will give me 100x or more... and I will ride those gems to crazy gains. 

What this post is about is essentially trying to catch lightning in a bottle. Good luck with that.

t3_mf1adv,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),one,
t3_mf1adv,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).   

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.   

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!   

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t3_mex8id,Earning Passive Crypto Income,one,
t3_mex8id,"This post aims  to highlight some of the ways to earn passive Crypto income. I'll share my findings and request everyone to please contribute their knowledge as well.

This list does not include the income which you can earn from Staking your tokens. So, kindly bear that in mind while discussing or providing your feedback. Also, with great sadness I'll remind everyone that this is not some Get-rich-quick scheme :) It's just there you earn some very small amounts, if you're willing.

I'll be glad to know what other opportunities are there for making a passive Crypto income.

I have discovered ways to earn the following tokens

1. BAT (Basic Attention Token)
2. TFUEL (Theta Fuel) Tokens
3. PRE (Presearch) Tokens

Following are some descriptions about these token earnings

# Earning BAT

* What is Brave/BAT?

[Brave browser](https://brave.com/) shows you personalized ads and in return it gives you the opportunity to earn BAT tokens. It also has a tipping system where you can tip content creators for their work (with BAT tokens).   
As of now BAT token as crossed $1 mark and in future it is expected to increase as the mainstream adoption comes.

* How to earn BAT?

All you need to do is download [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), enable **Brave Rewards** and start surfing the web, You'll be shown ads which will let you earn BAT tokens.

# Earning TFUEL tokens

* What is Theta Fuel?

Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is one of the two native tokens on the Theta blockchain. TFUEL should not be mistaken for[ Theta Token (THETA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/), which is the governance token of the Theta blockchain supported by thousands of community-run Guardian nodes and its Enterprise validators including Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi and Samsung. ([source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-fuel/))

* How to earn TFUEL?

To earn TFUEL tokens you need to setup a **THETA EDGE NODE,** which will cache popular network streams for the Theta network and reward you for providing this service.

Its very easy to setup, you need to visit [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website and download **THETA EDGE NODE** for Windows or Mac. Then you need to install it and provide your Theta Wallet address where you will be receiving the Theta tokens. After install, just let the Theta Edge Node running and it will do what it needs to power the Theta network.

Theta wallet can also be created on the [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website. Remember to store your password and key files in a secure location. 

# Earning Presearch tokens

* What is Presearch?

Presearch is a decentralized search engine, powered by the community. This search engine rewards you with PRE tokens for using it's search engine.

* How to earn PRE tokens?

You need to create an account at [presearch.org](https://presearch.org) and login with it. Then you can use the website to perform searches and be rewarded with Presearch tokens.

I found Presearch token earning to be the least useful as it has got many shady requirements for withdrawal.

1. Firstly, it won't let you withdraw unless you earn 1000 PRE token, which as per my calculations can take 3 to 4 months. 
2. Secondly, there is a limit on daily PRE token earnings (not sure about what the exact limit is). 
3. Thirdly, you have to go through some ranking system from 1 to 10 I guess; which makes it even worse by imposing limits on how much you can withdraw from your earnings.",one,

If they do help, I'd like to know which one of them is the best investment; I surfed the web and found out a lot of these groups that give out signals, but which one of them is the best? I searched Reddit as well but couldn't find an answer.

I went through a few of them and some of them have a very good ""track record"", as well, so you know, I was thinking of investing around $1000 and follow those signals, would that help me? I'm going to hold on to a few coins, but I'd also like to indulge in day trading, (or weekly or monthly trading), and would also like profits in that category.

t3_mf4w7x,Creating a Cryptocurrency from Scratch,one,
t3_mf4w7x," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a ""stablecoin"", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

Any help would be much appreciated!",one,

Let me know your thoughts! Here are some of mine...

I imagine a decentralized social media where profiles are created at the time of birth. Birth certificate transactions are the first to show up on a profile. Transactions for doctors appointments, the purchase of goods and services, education, employment, and optionally financial transactions all show up on the users profile. These all help prove that the person is a real person. Companies that can provide a block chain transaction to the profile become more valuable because they all help prove this is a real person that might be someone you'd be willing to lend to. These companies themselves all could have ratings from a decentralized review adding another layer of complexity. One hospital may be more positively reviewed then another hospital (Block chain transactions may be more reliable). The hospital you choose to have your kid in may in the future impact his/her ability to be lent money from a peer to peer lending service. 

Ultimately I see block-chain as a humongous database. Maybe someone could write a decentralized app that could look through all this data and rate the person on their likelihood of being good borrower for peer to per lending.",one,

2.

My question is do you need to put the apps back on the phone every time you want to store more crypto to your wallet? Also can someone see your accounts on Ledger live if they don't have the hardware wallet? I thought the point of it is you need the hardware wallet to act as a key to the account...

I'm positive I'll be able to exchange USDT for Hydro and then store it in a separate wallet for the time; I'm searching for coins exactly like Hydro, I'm thinking practically so I know I can't profit 100% overnight, hence why I'm looking forward to invest $4000 into coins that I'll be holding for the time (Monero, Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV, Cardano, Ripple, Binance BNB, Chainlink, Litecoin, Hydro, etc) and about Hydro, from what I've found out, it has a great community that has its back, it has a pretty decent reputation and all in all, it's a different, and a somewhat unique project; I've also subscribed to their subreddit.

I'm looking into indulging into day trading, by investing the remaining $1000 into coins that are either hit or miss, if I miss one and hit two, or hit one and miss two, I'll be super happy, I couldn't care less about the loss, per se, I'll be gaining experience, if anything, and besides, it isn't a loss as long as I don't sell right?

t3_mf1adv,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),bear,
t3_mf1adv,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).   

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.   

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

t3_mex8id,"This post aims  to highlight some of the ways to earn passive Crypto income. I'll share my findings and request everyone to please contribute their knowledge as well.

This list does not include the income which you can earn from Staking your tokens. So, kindly bear that in mind while discussing or providing your feedback. Also, with great sadness I'll remind everyone that this is not some Get-rich-quick scheme :) It's just there you earn some very small amounts, if you're willing.

I'll be glad to know what other opportunities are there for making a passive Crypto income.

I have discovered ways to earn the following tokens

1. BAT (Basic Attention Token)
2. TFUEL (Theta Fuel) Tokens
3. PRE (Presearch) Tokens

Following are some descriptions about these token earnings

# Earning BAT

* What is Brave/BAT?

[Brave browser](https://brave.com/) shows you personalized ads and in return it gives you the opportunity to earn BAT tokens. It also has a tipping system where you can tip content creators for their work (with BAT tokens).   
As of now BAT token as crossed $1 mark and in future it is expected to increase as the mainstream adoption comes.

* How to earn BAT?

All you need to do is download [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), enable **Brave Rewards** and start surfing the web, You'll be shown ads which will let you earn BAT tokens.

# Earning TFUEL tokens

* What is Theta Fuel?

Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is one of the two native tokens on the Theta blockchain. TFUEL should not be mistaken for[ Theta Token (THETA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/), which is the governance token of the Theta blockchain supported by thousands of community-run Guardian nodes and its Enterprise validators including Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi and Samsung. ([source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-fuel/))

* How to earn TFUEL?

To earn TFUEL tokens you need to setup a **THETA EDGE NODE,** which will cache popular network streams for the Theta network and reward you for providing this service.

Its very easy to setup, you need to visit [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website and download **THETA EDGE NODE** for Windows or Mac. Then you need to install it and provide your Theta Wallet address where you will be receiving the Theta tokens. After install, just let the Theta Edge Node running and it will do what it needs to power the Theta network.

Theta wallet can also be created on the [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website. Remember to store your password and key files in a secure location. 

# Earning Presearch tokens

* What is Presearch?

Presearch is a decentralized search engine, powered by the community. This search engine rewards you with PRE tokens for using it's search engine.

* How to earn PRE tokens?

You need to create an account at [presearch.org](https://presearch.org) and login with it. Then you can use the website to perform searches and be rewarded with Presearch tokens.

I found Presearch token earning to be the least useful as it has got many shady requirements for withdrawal.

1. Firstly, it won't let you withdraw unless you earn 1000 PRE token, which as per my calculations can take 3 to 4 months. 
2. Secondly, there is a limit on daily PRE token earnings (not sure about what the exact limit is). 
3. Thirdly, you have to go through some ranking system from 1 to 10 I guess; which makes it even worse by imposing limits on how much you can withdraw from your earnings.",bear,

As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

I'm positive I'll be able to exchange USDT for Hydro and then store it in a separate wallet for the time; I'm searching for coins exactly like Hydro, I'm thinking practically so I know I can't profit 100% overnight, hence why I'm looking forward to invest $4000 into coins that I'll be holding for the time (Monero, Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV, Cardano, Ripple, Binance BNB, Chainlink, Litecoin, Hydro, etc) and about Hydro, from what I've found out, it has a great community that has its back, it has a pretty decent reputation and all in all, it's a different, and a somewhat unique project; I've also subscribed to their subreddit.

I'm looking into indulging into day trading, by investing the remaining $1000 into coins that are either hit or miss, if I miss one and hit two, or hit one and miss two, I'll be super happy, I couldn't care less about the loss, per se, I'll be gaining experience, if anything, and besides, it isn't a loss as long as I don't sell right? And for this reason, I was looking into one of those paid groups that give out signals, from what I've read about them, they too are hit or miss, but those groups have ""track records"", and claim that they get two out of three right, which is pretty exciting and something I'm up for; what would you advise me about those groups?

t3_mf7ms0,Staking question,long,
t3_mf7ms0,"Hey guys,

I'm new to the cryptocurrency but I really like to inform myself on the subject.

I bought some cryptos beginning of february and I would like to earn some passive incomes on that. I have heard about staking and I have a few questions, if someone could help me.

Is there a ""best"" crypto to stake ? I really like ADA. It was my first crypto and I really like the project and the potential that it has but there is ""only 5%"" on wallets like Yoroi. I know 5% is a lot, don't get me wrong. My bank only gives me 0.1%... But my question is more : is there a crypto that is more attractive to stake ?

My second question is about Tether USDT. I know that it's a stable coin. On some websites APY can go up to 9%. Since Tether is a stablecoin, is it really risky ? I mean, BTC and other cryptos can fluctuate a lot, but USDT will always follow the dollar. Would it be a good plan to stake Tether on the long term ? I feel like it's not as risky as with other cryptos but maybe I am missing something ? I could just put 10.000 USDT for staking, come back in 10 years with 10.000 USDT more ""without any risks since it's a stable coin""?

I'm just asking for advice, I know you're not my financial advisors so don't worry, just say what you think.

Thanks,

Smartlands is not about any hype, neither is it a pump and dump coin like you are probably betting on.

There is a difference on ""betting"" on a pump and dump coin, and investing in a solid project for the long term like Smartlands.

I think you're betting on very high risk, with high reward if succesfull (if you step out early enough). Everything is high risk in crypto, but the solid projects are the least risky.

t3_mf1adv,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),link,
t3_mf1adv,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).   

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.   

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!   

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

Its the last chance. Hurry up. Dont miss it.

Their presale is currently live and 99 of 100 phases are finished.

The ico price is still really low with 0.017 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.022 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


There are three options to participate:
  - buy STC via Credit Card
  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet
  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay or underpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.

t3_mex8id,Earning Passive Crypto Income,bat,
t3_mex8id,"This post aims  to highlight some of the ways to earn passive Crypto income. I'll share my findings and request everyone to please contribute their knowledge as well.

This list does not include the income which you can earn from Staking your tokens. So, kindly bear that in mind while discussing or providing your feedback. Also, with great sadness I'll remind everyone that this is not some Get-rich-quick scheme :) It's just there you earn some very small amounts, if you're willing.

I'll be glad to know what other opportunities are there for making a passive Crypto income.

I have discovered ways to earn the following tokens

1. BAT (Basic Attention Token)
2. TFUEL (Theta Fuel) Tokens
3. PRE (Presearch) Tokens

Following are some descriptions about these token earnings

# Earning BAT

* What is Brave/BAT?

[Brave browser](https://brave.com/) shows you personalized ads and in return it gives you the opportunity to earn BAT tokens. It also has a tipping system where you can tip content creators for their work (with BAT tokens).   
As of now BAT token as crossed $1 mark and in future it is expected to increase as the mainstream adoption comes.

* How to earn BAT?

All you need to do is download [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), enable **Brave Rewards** and start surfing the web, You'll be shown ads which will let you earn BAT tokens.

# Earning TFUEL tokens

* What is Theta Fuel?

Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is one of the two native tokens on the Theta blockchain. TFUEL should not be mistaken for[ Theta Token (THETA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/), which is the governance token of the Theta blockchain supported by thousands of community-run Guardian nodes and its Enterprise validators including Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi and Samsung. ([source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-fuel/))

* How to earn TFUEL?

To earn TFUEL tokens you need to setup a **THETA EDGE NODE,** which will cache popular network streams for the Theta network and reward you for providing this service.

Its very easy to setup, you need to visit [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website and download **THETA EDGE NODE** for Windows or Mac. Then you need to install it and provide your Theta Wallet address where you will be receiving the Theta tokens. After install, just let the Theta Edge Node running and it will do what it needs to power the Theta network.

Theta wallet can also be created on the [Theta Token](https://www.thetatoken.org/) website. Remember to store your password and key files in a secure location. 

# Earning Presearch tokens

* What is Presearch?

Presearch is a decentralized search engine, powered by the community. This search engine rewards you with PRE tokens for using it's search engine.

* How to earn PRE tokens?

You need to create an account at [presearch.org](https://presearch.org) and login with it. Then you can use the website to perform searches and be rewarded with Presearch tokens.

I found Presearch token earning to be the least useful as it has got many shady requirements for withdrawal.

1. Firstly, it won't let you withdraw unless you earn 1000 PRE token, which as per my calculations can take 3 to 4 months. 
2. Secondly, there is a limit on daily PRE token earnings (not sure about what the exact limit is). 
3. Thirdly, you have to go through some ranking system from 1 to 10 I guess; which makes it even worse by imposing limits on how much you can withdraw from your earnings.",bat,

However, after setting it up, I'm quite confused with the transferring of funds (such as from NiceHash, I can only transfer $50 of Bitcoin at a time, and with BAT, there's a fee for the transfer). With this, I am wondering if a Hardware Wallet is even worth it? I get it protects against hacks from stealing my cryptocurrency, but why don't I just deposit what I've earned into my bank account and do away with the hardware wallet, as it just seems a hassle to carry around?

t3_mf4w7x,Creating a Cryptocurrency from Scratch,bitcoin,
t3_mf4w7x," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a ""stablecoin"", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

Any help would be much appreciated!",bitcoin,

I'm positive I'll be able to exchange USDT for Hydro and then store it in a separate wallet for the time; I'm searching for coins exactly like Hydro, I'm thinking practically so I know I can't profit 100% overnight, hence why I'm looking forward to invest $4000 into coins that I'll be holding for the time (Monero, Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV, Cardano, Ripple, Binance BNB, Chainlink, Litecoin, Hydro, etc) and about Hydro, from what I've found out, it has a great community that has its back, it has a pretty decent reputation and all in all, it's a different, and a somewhat unique project; I've also subscribed to their subreddit.

I'm looking into indulging into day trading, by investing the remaining $1000 into coins that are either hit or miss, if I miss one and hit two, or hit one and miss two, I'll be super happy, I couldn't care less about the loss, per se, I'll be gaining experience, if anything, and besides, it isn't a loss as long as I don't sell right? And for this reason, I was looking into one of those paid groups that give out signals, from what I've read about them, they too are hit or miss, but those groups have ""track records"", and claim that they get two out of three right, which is pretty exciting and something I'm up for; what would you advise me about those groups?

I'm going to apply for the verification of my Binance account tomorrow (they wouldn't let me do anything unless I verify) and after that's done and dusted, I'll deposit the funds into my account and start my journey; I'm so fucking excited and initially, it was between choosing one of the three; Forex, Stock Market and Crypto — I'm a hundred percent certain I've made the right decision and I've come to the right place.",bitcoin,

t3_mf8fiw,"WHAT - 

Poltergeist exchange launched 31 Jan 2021. It is a very early stage centralised exchange that will transform into a truly untraceable decentralised exchange in late 2021. 

An untraceable, private and secure crypto ecosystem that will be ever more important as governments demand more and more access to our wallets, trade history and maybe our keys. Poltergeist has a use case. 

$Ghoul is the native token of Poltergeist exchange. It has a total supply of 100M coins but over +30M coins have been burned. At time of writing $Ghoul is trading at $0.10 which would provide a fully diluted market cap of between $6-7M. 

————————————————————————————

WHO - BULLISH!!!


Josh Case (Founder of Poltergeist - previously founder of Ethershift and Clearpoll and co-founder of Ghost by McAfee)

JOHN MCAFEE - Yes the creator and owner of McAfee Antivirus. The PR and tech magician with almost a cult following as well as years of experience running a multi million $ business. John has partnered his coin Ghost by McAfee with Poltergeist and will be working closely with the team. 

Mate Tokay - Co-founder of Bitcoin.com and bringing an advisory role to Poltergeist. 

“I am really happy to join these projects and help bring a true private crypto currency ecosystem to the world” - Mate Tokay 

“Nothing can stop us from bringing these ideas to the world. And a lot of these ideas are closer than you may think.” - Josh Case 

“Bitcoin, generally, is a great idea. Keeping wallets on smartphones is the worst idea of the decade.” - John McAfee 

————————————————————————————

WHERE - 

Poltergeistexchange.com 

You can buy $Ghoul tokens directly from the exchange but as it is very new and with quite low volume it can be more better to buy directly from Uniswap.

Please note this is still a centralised exchange but will transform later this year into a fully decentralised exchange that will not operate on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Uniswap - you can buy $Ghoul tokens directly from Uniswap. 

Contract address: 0x3bb86d867a9f3addf994cdadb210fa82f0d4157a

Please feel free to check the contract address on Etherscan to verify that it is authentic. 

Do not try to buy $Ghoul from Uniswap with any other contract address - unfortunately a lot of scams taking place at the moment. 

————————————————————————————

WHEN - 

Roadmap: 

10-24 Jan 21 - $Ghoul private sale ✅

I bought some cryptos beginning of february and I would like to earn some passive incomes on that. I have heard about staking and I have a few questions, if someone could help me.

Is there a ""best"" crypto to stake ? I really like ADA. It was my first crypto and I really like the project and the potential that it has but there is ""only 5%"" on wallets like Yoroi. I know 5% is a lot, don't get me wrong. My bank only gives me 0.1%... But my question is more : is there a crypto that is more attractive to stake ?

My second question is about Tether USDT. I know that it's a stable coin. On some websites APY can go up to 9%. Since Tether is a stablecoin, is it really risky ? I mean, BTC and other cryptos can fluctuate a lot, but USDT will always follow the dollar. Would it be a good plan to stake Tether on the long term ? I feel like it's not as risky as with other cryptos but maybe I am missing something ? I could just put 10.000 USDT for staking, come back in 10 years with 10.000 USDT more ""without any risks since it's a stable coin""?

I'm just asking for advice, I know you're not my financial advisors so don't worry, just say what you think.

Thanks,

There are three options to participate:
  - buy STC via Credit Card
  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet
  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay or underpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.

Now keep in mind I'm not an expert, but to answer your first part:

Liquidity staking is when you provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange(DEX) by staking equal amounts of two different coins through their liquidity protocols. You can then passively earn a portion of the fees that are collected when people trade that coin pair on the exchange. You'll need to find a wallet which allows you to do this. 

There's a bit to understand here before you get into it, such as eth fees and impermanent loss.

t3_mf4w7x,Creating a Cryptocurrency from Scratch,etc,
t3_mf4w7x," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a ""stablecoin"", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

t3_mf8fiw,"WHAT - 

Poltergeist exchange launched 31 Jan 2021. It is a very early stage centralised exchange that will transform into a truly untraceable decentralised exchange in late 2021. 

An untraceable, private and secure crypto ecosystem that will be ever more important as governments demand more and more access to our wallets, trade history and maybe our keys. Poltergeist has a use case. 

$Ghoul is the native token of Poltergeist exchange. It has a total supply of 100M coins but over +30M coins have been burned. At time of writing $Ghoul is trading at $0.10 which would provide a fully diluted market cap of between $6-7M. 

————————————————————————————

WHO - BULLISH!!!


Josh Case (Founder of Poltergeist - previously founder of Ethershift and Clearpoll and co-founder of Ghost by McAfee)

JOHN MCAFEE - Yes the creator and owner of McAfee Antivirus. The PR and tech magician with almost a cult following as well as years of experience running a multi million $ business. John has partnered his coin Ghost by McAfee with Poltergeist and will be working closely with the team. 

Mate Tokay - Co-founder of Bitcoin.com and bringing an advisory role to Poltergeist.

“Nothing can stop us from bringing these ideas to the world. And a lot of these ideas are closer than you may think.” - Josh Case

————————————————————————————

WHERE - 

Poltergeistexchange.com 

You can buy $Ghoul tokens directly from the exchange but as it is very new and with quite low volume it can be more better to buy directly from Uniswap.

Please note this is still a centralised exchange but will transform later this year into a fully decentralised exchange that will not operate on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Uniswap - you can buy $Ghoul tokens directly from Uniswap. 

Contract address: 0x3bb86d867a9f3addf994cdadb210fa82f0d4157a

Please feel free to check the contract address on Etherscan to verify that it is authentic. 

Do not try to buy $Ghoul from Uniswap with any other contract address - unfortunately a lot of scams taking place at the moment.

I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay or underpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.

Poltergeist exchange launched 31 Jan 2021. It is a very early stage centralised exchange that will transform into a truly untraceable decentralised exchange in late 2021. 

An untraceable, private and secure crypto ecosystem that will be ever more important as governments demand more and more access to our wallets, trade history and maybe our keys. Poltergeist has a use case. 

$Ghoul is the native token of Poltergeist exchange. It has a total supply of 100M coins but over +30M coins have been burned. At time of writing $Ghoul is trading at $0.10 which would provide a fully diluted market cap of between $6-7M.

t3_mf4w7x,Creating a Cryptocurrency from Scratch,ethereum,
t3_mf4w7x," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a ""stablecoin"", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

Any help would be much appreciated!",ethereum,

t3_mewz09,can Snowge Coin realistically 100x from here?,doge,
t3_mewz09,"Hi guys, this is an earnest post and really just wanna get some discussion. 

I am absolutely invested in Snowge for transparency but there's nothing wrong with that right ? 

we are not enemies here, we all want to everyone to win (at least I do). 

So some of you may or may not have heard of this project called snowge coin and it's honestly such a refresher in the bsc space. 

I got invested becuase I hope they become a success as someone who passionately cares about animals and their well being.

I think with the low market cap, and cmc plus gc imminent and then whitebit coming shortly there after, they can take off. 


So these points under are from my own brain and my own objective thoughts after being in the community for the last 4 days. (they are on day 6 of the project) 



I ENCOURAGE people to comment their thoughts no matter if they are good or bad I just want to hear the communites sentiment. I think the majority of us are good people so please just keep it respectful is all I ask 🙏🙏



1) snowge is extremely marketable. I envision a snowge, doge, and hoge ecosystem in the future 

2) we have the only deflationary tokenomics with a pretty low supply cap, random tax system and is fully unruggable (proven) 

3) once our smart contracts for animal shelters come through and we enter the nfts space it will further differentiate us from the safe shit

4) we have not even gotten listed in cmc or cg (which is coming) and it's my understanding whitebit will not be far away after that. 

5) the developers here are personally invested, they threw away 600k usd into a burn wallet to ensure that they are not tempted to become a scam coin. Thus this is absolutely non ruggable (again ) 

6) and lastly this is a project that was started to honestly make a difference in the lives of animals who have been abused and neglected. it's such an honorable cause and we have the best memes and artists. Have you heard our rap that a member just created ?? 

basically guys this is literally just the beginning, even if you bought the local top and are down a massive percentage, that was but a local top. we will surely most positively smash that high. 

and to the people buying now, I am extremely jealous and you're lucky",doge,
t1_gskgzf0,"Please dude please don't. My pc was spared but my friends got fried. Also I indeed was never paid. Neither for the memes. I went down the road of private coin mining. It's really fun and simple and gets your payments hourly. Though as for the income, it's not the best, depending on electricity cost (still better than folding) but propably many of these private coins will increase in value IMO. 

Also Banano has done it's pumps and dumps. If your thing is begging , as it is for many others , join the discord, play nice and you will get tipped like 0.001$ per day, or even more. If it's not, but you like memes go to Doge, WoWnero , or turtlecoin. Doge is the king, WoWnero is like Archer Sterling of doge, and turtlecoin is like Miami vice of crypto. Also you will get my obey for being yourself instead of a kiss ass in discord, and get paid also for your memes.

t3_mf4sbj,Best ICO in 2021?,litecoin,
t3_mf4sbj,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021.


The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.


The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.


Its the last chance. Hurry up. Dont miss it.

Their presale is currently live and 99 of 100 phases are finished.

The ico price is still really low with 0.017 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.022 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


There are three options to participate:
  - buy STC via Credit Card
  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet
  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay or underpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.

CODE: Sxlb8setj7


Or the link: https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sxlb8setj7


Wish you good luck. See you at $1 soon I hope.

t3_meuza0,"Where do you think block chain technology will go in the future?

Let me know your thoughts! Here are some of mine...

I imagine a decentralized social media where profiles are created at the time of birth. Birth certificate transactions are the first to show up on a profile. Transactions for doctors appointments, the purchase of goods and services, education, employment, and optionally financial transactions all show up on the users profile. These all help prove that the person is a real person. Companies that can provide a block chain transaction to the profile become more valuable because they all help prove this is a real person that might be someone you'd be willing to lend to. These companies themselves all could have ratings from a decentralized review adding another layer of complexity. One hospital may be more positively reviewed then another hospital (Block chain transactions may be more reliable). The hospital you choose to have your kid in may in the future impact his/her ability to be lent money from a peer to peer lending service. 

Ultimately I see block-chain as a humongous database. Maybe someone could write a decentralized app that could look through all this data and rate the person on their likelihood of being good borrower for peer to per lending.",lend,

I'm new to the cryptocurrency but I really like to inform myself on the subject.

I bought some cryptos beginning of february and I would like to earn some passive incomes on that. I have heard about staking and I have a few questions, if someone could help me.

Is there a ""best"" crypto to stake ? I really like ADA. It was my first crypto and I really like the project and the potential that it has but there is ""only 5%"" on wallets like Yoroi. I know 5% is a lot, don't get me wrong. My bank only gives me 0.1%... But my question is more : is there a crypto that is more attractive to stake ?

My second question is about Tether USDT. I know that it's a stable coin. On some websites APY can go up to 9%. Since Tether is a stablecoin, is it really risky ? I mean, BTC and other cryptos can fluctuate a lot, but USDT will always follow the dollar. Would it be a good plan to stake Tether on the long term ? I feel like it's not as risky as with other cryptos but maybe I am missing something ? I could just put 10.000 USDT for staking, come back in 10 years with 10.000 USDT more ""without any risks since it's a stable coin""?

t1_gslef2t,"Sure thing! When you say chuck your ADA into liquid do you mean into a liquidity pool? Or the LIQUID coin? 


Now keep in mind I'm not an expert, but to answer your first part:

Liquidity staking is when you provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange(DEX) by staking equal amounts of two different coins through their liquidity protocols. You can then passively earn a portion of the fees that are collected when people trade that coin pair on the exchange. You'll need to find a wallet which allows you to do this. 

There's a bit to understand here before you get into it, such as eth fees and impermanent loss. It is more risky than simply holding the coins, and I'd recommend checking out this [article.](https://academy-binance-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-yield-farming-in-decentralized-finance-defi.amp?amp_gsa=1&amp;amp_js_v=a6&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#how-are-yield-farming-returns-calculated)",ada,

t1_gsmsjce,"Thank you so much for the warm welcome, and thank you for the brilliant suggestion, I've looked it up and it does look very promising to me, but the only turndown is that it isn't available on Binance (Binance is the only service which *actually* works in Pakistan, Kraken does too but it has a number of restrictions on Pakistani users while Binance has very few and those restrictions can be overlooked)

I'm positive I'll be able to exchange USDT for Hydro and then store it in a separate wallet for the time; I'm searching for coins exactly like Hydro, I'm thinking practically so I know I can't profit 100% overnight, hence why I'm looking forward to invest $4000 into coins that I'll be holding for the time (Monero, Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV, Cardano, Ripple, Binance BNB, Chainlink, Litecoin, Hydro, etc) and about Hydro, from what I've found out, it has a great community that has its back, it has a pretty decent reputation and all in all, it's a different, and a somewhat unique project; I've also subscribed to their subreddit.

I'm looking into indulging into day trading, by investing the remaining $1000 into coins that are either hit or miss, if I miss one and hit two, or hit one and miss two, I'll be super happy, I couldn't care less about the loss, per se, I'll be gaining experience, if anything, and besides, it isn't a loss as long as I don't sell right?

t3_mf6zql,$FVT Vote Finance’s revolutionary quadratic voting system will make you stop looking for deflationary assets,white,
t3_mf6zql,"What does deflationary actually mean?

Typically, we discuss deflation as a positive thing in economics. In that context, it refers to the falling prices of everyday items, thereby providing each individual, or holder, with more purchasing power

But what does it mean in a closed ecosystem in which there is no trade of perishable goods or stable number of holders? **For a coin like HOGE, do deflationary aspects actually improve the tokenomics or equity of the asset?**

Relative to inflationary, it’s not so bad. Inflationary tokenomics typically involve mining or yield farming, **allowing the money printer to go BRRRRRR for your biggest holders** in activities that are not as practical for your smaller holders.

So, with deflationary assets, the decrease in supply increases value proportionally for all holders across the board. Better right?

**Not so fast.** For anyone to win with HOGE, it is dependent on new buyers entering the system. With the price increasing for every decrease in supply, this system still negatively impacts new buyers who the current holders are depending on.

**So, regardless of how you set tokenomics, it doesn’t really matter in the scheme of things.** Whales win. Holders get diamonds hands. Power is centralized.

**But that’s not what we got into decentralized finance for, right?** This is supposed to upend traditional finance and provide everyone the opportunity to properly invest and accumulate wealth.

This is where Finance Vote provides their revolutionary quadratic voting system which can **change the way we handle all governance tokens**. And seriously, I mean **ALL** of them.

If you’re Mr. “I read the white paper” then please, by all means, [go ahead](https://f646e629-e6ab-436e-b4b5-ad62237799a8.filesusr.com/ugd/2f63aa_acbd8518e6cb4b20ae956ef661f85335.pdf). **Written by a team with multiple doctorate degrees on board,** backgrounds in both DeFi and traditional marketing and finance, It’s actually quite the treat.

But if you ape, whitepaper make brain go sad, it basically goes something like this. Finance.vote handles KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures through **ID’s in the form of NFT’s, called Decentralized Identity Tokens, or DIT’s.**

These DIT’s allow you to vote on a variety of measures. However, the more votes you make on different measures, the less power each vote has.  This reduces the power of a single DIT to impact voting more than, say, a person who is really only interested in one issue.

This is important, because voter apathy is real, and just because someone chooses not to vote on a particular issue, it doesn’t mean other people should have more collective power.

Now, this is still pretty easy to exploit. All you have to do is create multiple identities and then you get more votes. I’m sure we’ve all seen this happen *somewhere*.

Without being able to verify identity through some regulatory agency, thus preventing DeFi from achieving its dream of cutting out third parties, there is just no realistic way to do KYC effectively to prevent this.

**So, Finance Vote simply allows you to buy more identities with FVT, but at increasing cost per buy, with supply burning at each purchase to reward all holders.**

While this may not seem like such a smart idea if you’re from a developed country, allowing people to buy votes, it ignores the reality that people will find ways to do so regardless and that, for most traditional companies, and most of DeFi, stocks and tokens are essentially votes you can accumulate.

It also ignores that half of the world lives undocumented, and, without this system, would never be able to vote in finance anyway. And since each additional vote costs significantly more than the one prior, there will be diminishing returns, acting as a much larger deterrent to accumulating power than we’ve seen thus far in *any* system, traditional or decentralized.

Finance Vote has also added true merit-based aspects to this voting system, getting further away from holders simply winning for holding. **They’ve taken their second-layer governance system and applied it to create an entire ecosystem.**

One that I want to highlight is [finance.vote](http://finance.vote/), a market predictions platform that provides a gamified approach for users.

Like how eToro allows you to copy other traders’ portfolios and moves, or Reef Finance ($400M cap) allows you to invest in baskets, or collections of different tokens, each vote on a market prediction gets recorded and is available for other traders to see.

As DIT’s get associated with making correct calls, they become more valuable (and are also tradeable). This is because **the system actually weighs their input more heavily when curating discovery of tokens on the platform.** This seems a fair and merit-based reward for increasing the viability of the platform through correct market predictions.

In itself, this is a fantastic idea and will likely make investors a ton of money if they follow the voting signals which are designed to drown out whale action.

But this is particularly interesting to me as Reef, once again, a **$400M company,** has forged a **partnership with Finance Vote** in order to utilize both their market indicators as well as their voting system.

Think about that. **Think about them being able to license this voting system, which reverses the benefits of economies of scale, the problems of traditional finance which bleed into DeFi, and sets us on a course for equity.**

Forget inflationary, forget deflationary, none of it matters if we just cap off the influence of big power and restore equity in finance.

**At an $8M market cap, Finance Vote is legitimately a contender to be a billion dollar asset.** The functionality of its system is truly second to none, and can redefine the DeFi space and solve so many issues of market manipulation that we’re all seeing.

Oh, and don’t forget that this is just **ONE** part of their ecosystem? You can check out [yield.vote](http://yield.vote/), [influence.vote](http://influence.vote/), [auction.vote](http://auction.vote/). While these are all impressive in their own right, I know you’re chomping at the bit to buy some FVT so DYOR on the rest.

So whether you pick up a bag to get rich from the whale-resistant market prediction system, or because you can see its ability to be a licensing giant partnering with every major DeFi player, just know you’re in for one hell of a ride behind an extremely respectable team helping prove the value of DeFi in solving real world problems.

**Tl;dr: Doxxed and accomplished team partnering with $400M cap projects, with a revolutionary voting system and NFT-based ID’s that will close the gap on the inequities and market manipulation plaguing DeFi so that it can truly replace traditional finance, with a full-utility token that burns supply when spent on minting new ID’s.**

t3_mf16ea,Bogtools (BOG) - a BSC token with real utility,one,
t3_mf16ea,"Allow me to get evangelical about my love for BOG. If you just want a quick rundown, check the lightpaper at [bogtools.io](https://bogtools.io/lightpaper.pdf), otherwise, allow me to wax lyrical on why this is the best new token on BSC right now. Disclaimer: I hold and stake BOG since day 1 of the project and am still buying and staking now. 

First off, the usecase and tokenomics of this project mean that BOG is absolutely not a typical BSC shitcoin. However, it will revolutionize the BSC shitcoin trading game. Do you love to trade garbage like HarambeDoge Protocol, PonziBomb, SafeBetelgeuse, and RUGIN24? Is your strategy for trading these to get in and out like a thief for a quick 10x before the hype dies or the devs disappear? If so then you'll definitely want to read on. 

Bogtools is a suite of dApps for use on the Binance Smart Chain, centred around oracles that can be deployed for any token on the BSC, regardless of whether they are listed on any exchanges.

The first app, released a few days after launch, was BogCharts. This uses the oracles to display a price chart for any token on BSC. This is neat not only because many projects do not have these until they are listed in places like CMC and CoinGecko, but also because the data shown is gathered directly from the blockchain, instead of an exchange ledger. This gives more accurate and up to date charting than is available elsewhere for BSC tokens, and allows developers of new projects to have an accurate price chart from day one. 

The second tool to be released was a verifiable random number generator (RNG), which uses a cryptographic function to prove that the number has not been tampered with in any way. The fact that this can be audited and proven to be reliably random means that it can be implemented in other projects that require it, such as casinos and lotteries, or anything that requires chance to function. 

The third (and most important) tool is slated to arrive on or before the 2nd of April: [limit orders](https://imgur.com/a/dZgeyzf) for Pancakeswap pairs. This will be implemented on the Bogtools site, and will allow you to create limit buys and sells on assets tradeable on Pancakeswap. This will be tested for reliability on 4 (four) token pairs to begin with, then rolled out to all assets shortly thereafter. Stoplosses will follow shortly after that. This is a huge deal for anyone who trades BSC shitcoins. Currently if you want to trade a newly created token, all buys and sells must be processed manually. ""What if saferug moons while I'm asleep?"" will never be a question you need to worry about again. 

The devs have stated that this can be improved upon in the future to activate upon a variety of specific triggers such as a dev wallet removing liquidity. You will be able to setup an order to sell all of your saferug *in the same block* as the trigger activity takes place. Meaning that you will be able to trade these ponzicoins and rugmoons with **significantly** reduced risk. If you as a reader of r/cryptomoonshots cannot see the immense value in this, then I don't know what to tell you. 

In order to implement these dApps, the user must pay a flat fee (pegged to USD) in BOG. The fees will then be distributed to stakers, used to pay the gas fees, and sent to the development team in order to grow the project. The fee for limit orders will be $2.50, paid in BOG. 

Currently, the token has a 4.5% fee on all transactions. This is sent directly to stakers' wallets. The devs have stated that this will in time be dropped to 0, in line with the rewards from dApp users rising. This is being done with the intention of keeping the staking rewards healthy, and has led to the kind of devoted community that cheers any and all price action because it pays stakers handsomely. Check out the Bogtools Telegram on a day where crypto as a whole is correcting and you will see no panic. 

""So wtf is bogged.finance?” you ask. This is where the project gets really cool IMO. Bogged is an ARG which incentivises users to hold and stake BOG in return for rewards in an ever-evolving game which is currently in its very early stages. The pregame had players coordinating across every social platform to reveal clues hidden inside scrambled audio clips, decode cyphers hidden in promo videos, and scrabble around in Minecraft servers looking for a password, in order to start the countdown to the real game. It really brought out the best in the community and it makes me very excited to see where the game goes. The two material things that have come out of the game so far are the Sminem NFT's and the NGMI token. 

The NGMI token is given to you whenever you sell BOG. This token cannot be traded and is intended as a mark of shame that will forever mark your wallet as unclean. It is speculated that this will have some effects later in the game, and potentially in the governance protocols that will be introduced later in 2021.

Sminem NFT's were available to the first 500 people to claim them. However, you had to stake for 24 hours to get the chance to claim him, and holders of NGMI were barred from claiming. 

To have no NGMI, a Sminem and an untouched stake is considered a huge badge of honour in the BOG community. Who even knows what will come next, but the devs have stated there will be some more features to the ARG coming very soon, in addition to another round of 250 Sminems for those who were unable to claim one last time around. 


So, on to the important questions:

Q: When moon?
A: BOG has its biggest feature being released in 6 days. There is over $250k in the marketing wallet. Confirmed mentions from some major crypto YouTubers coming up imminently. Code is original, useful and innovative. Market cap is still very small at $16m. No presale, fair distribution. I won't say it will definitely moon but the ingredients for moon are all here. Just don't expect a quick 10x overnight, as the liquidity pool is very deep thanks to all of the staking taking place. 

Q: Who are the devs? Do they inspire confidence?
A: There are 2 lead devs, John and Luke. Luke is self-doxxed (socials, face and voice) and John plans to do the same after Bogtools is incorporated. They have done 4 (four) discord AMA's in which they have come across as intelligent, motivated and trustworthy. You can find these on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vFdfDuz9Fqk) and listen for yourself. 

Q: OK, I have BOG. Should I stake it?
A: Only you can decide this. Be aware of the risks of impermanent loss (IL), but also be aware that early stakers have already doubled their stack. It should be worth it if you set and forget, but may not be worth it if you plan on unstaking soon. Ask on Telegram and you will get some well informed, yet weary answers (this makes up a good chunk of the debate on there). 

Q: What is the major FUD against this project?
A: Firstly, that ETH fees will decrease to the level where BSC becomes irrelevant. Devs have answered this by saying that if ETH fees are lowered to BSC levels, they will launch Bogtools for ETH as well. 

Secondly, the question of ""if this is doable, why haven't Pancakeswap implemented charts and limit orders themselves?"" Bogtools has first mover advantage here, and if Pancakeswap was able to do this, they would have done it already. Seeing as their code is not original (it's a fork of Uniswap), there is little likelihood of them implementing this in the near future. 

As of right now, the market cap is $16 million, which IMO is very small for what this project may deliver. This is not a clone or a fork, it's an original and innovative project and a real boon to the whole BSC. It should go far.

t3_mfbuhw,Why $EBOX will become one of the greats. Very comfortable x10 can be found here.,one,
t3_mfbuhw,"Sup y'all!   
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves an easy way to get rid of wallet trackers, remain truly anonymous on the public blockchain and more.  
(now that the degens havent clicked on this post because of the title: this is actually a **100x** or more moonshot)

# So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. EBOX has the solution.   
Using the unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

That's a cool idea that will help many newcomers on crypto but as people get more familiar with crypto this problem fades away, and then a new problem arises. Anonymity.

**That is why I actually like this one.**

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:** 

&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

it probably won’t take long for them to establish themselves in a rapidly growing market.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Tokenomics, Product and User Adoption, Driver of Value

&amp;#x200B;

* `Token Type: ERC20`
* `Overall Supply:` `1.000.000.000`
* `Current Circulating Supply:  200.000.000`
* `Current Market Cap: ~ 3.5 million`
* `Current Holders (Etherscan): 844`  


The project started without any token sale for $XGG. Currently the total liquidity on Uniswap is over 2.5 Million USDT, what’s quite noteworthy for a new project without any pre sale and such small market cap, whereby 50% of liquidity is locked via unicrypt.   [LINK](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0x123b5a3a816aeb1c901e58bc81937fcf159269fe) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*1st Driver of Value:*  
***The Onboarding of other ERC20 tokens on the platform***

10x offers an opportunity to other companies to join the platform with their native tokens.  
They will be able to apply for token listings and need to pay for the listing services with $XGG.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision. 

:) cheerz

t3_mf3ult,"I hope you all listened to me about $RED-P &amp; $YELLOW-P the other day. $0.72 to $4.65 and $9.84 to $65.40! Both projects less than 500k MC and both part of a new, innovative DeFi Yield Farm.",one,
t3_mf3ult,"I'm referring to [this post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mdvcah/redp_my_take_on_why_right_now_is_the_perfect/) the other day and [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/meejv9/redp_token_with_lots_of_potential_perfect_time_to/) made by another passionate member of our community, /u/Rotomboy. I'm not going to bore you with all the long details I wrote up in the original post, if you want to learn more and DYOR then check the links above.

The reason I'm posting again is to make you aware just **how crazy early it still is.** The team have announced another new feature is coming this evening (European time). I think I know what it is &amp; don't want to spoil it - but it will be yet another innovative gamification of your typical Yield Farms. This is exciting because I've not seen it done before &amp; it's just another method to continue contributing to the **scarcity of both tokens &amp; attract more farmers.**

As I referenced in the title, $RED-P is now climbing back up to it's ATH of $20. When I made my last post, it was $0.72 and hit $4.65 earlier. To make things even more exciting, if you had bought YELLOW-P when I made that post, you would have **watched it climb from $9.84... to $65.40 earlier today!** They've both dipped a bit since as people took profit (and you'd be crazy not to with those gains) - so this is probably right about a good time to ""buy the dip"" :)

**Quick TL;DR for those of you who decide not to click and read the more extensive threads I linked above:**

* Both tokens have a limited supply, with tokenomics to **burn more with every transaction** and add to the liquidity pool + distribute to farmers. There is *less than 100,000 RED-P and less than 10,000 YELLOW-P* and over time, these numbers will continue to decrease, driving more and more demand. This isn't like your typical Yield Farm that mint new tokens every block.
* There's a dynamic transaction limit to stop whales from dumping massive amounts of tokens and crashing the market
* The fee structure (which you can read more about in the thread above) is made in such a way that it incentivizes people to farm and hold, rather than pull out profits too often. Yet another good way to increase demand.
* There's a YELLOW-P jackpot with a 1/10 chance to win 10% of it and **1/100 chance to win ALL OF IT**. You roll this chance every time you make a transaction for YELLOW-P. Someone won nearly $500 a few hours ago. 
* The tokens are linked. You can't buy YELLOW-P without first buying RED-P to swap to it with. This is just another way of increasing demand.

So, why am I so excited? Apart from all the reasons listed here and in the previous threads - just look at the big picture. This isn't some meme-token with no use-case. If either of the tokens were to hit $1000 each, they would **still be less than $100m market cap**. *How crazy is that?* And to top it off, the combined $TVL of both tokens is still **less than $200k!** In a world where a meme-token like Hoge or Safemoon can hit $200m market-cap just through hype - where do you think a token that actually has a tiny supply will go? And the best part is, you can either hold or you can stake in the farm and watch your passive income trickle in.

Anyway, I will let you make your own decisions based on the merits here and in the previous threads. Please see below for all the details:

💊 **$RED-P - https://red.pill.finance**

* Total supply: 100,000
* Initial circulating supply: 25,000
* Ticker Symbol: RED-P
* Transaction fee: 1% (30% instant burn, 70% will flow back into the yield farm pool)
* [Max transaction size](https://i.imgur.com/llwSpFj.png)
* [Reward per block](https://i.imgur.com/Ykzkn3v.png)

💲 **How to buy**

* 1-2% slippage should be fine
* You can buy direct on the Red Pill site: https://exchange.pill.finance/#/swap 
* You can also buy on Pancakeswap if you wish: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x137fAAD0d13813ef8D4CBBB336F0E01066B2C9B4

💊 **$YELLOW-P - https://yellow.pill.finance**

* Total supply: 10,000
* Initial circulating supply: 1,000
* Ticker Symbol: YELLOW-P (Why didn't they choose YELP lol)
* Transaction fee: 9% (10% instant burn, 20% in jackpot, 70% will flow back into the yield farm pool)
* [Reward per block](https://i.imgur.com/E3d97Bt.png)

💲 **How to buy**

* You can buy direct on pill.finance: https://exchange.pill.finance/#/swap 
* You can also buy on Pancakeswap if you wish: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xa99b1198C19Fb05d004C4fa5a3C9d29F33B5a687

* BscScan: https://bscscan.com/token/0xa99b1198c19fb05d004c4fa5a3c9d29f33b5a687
* **REMEMBER** - you swap RED-P for YELLOW-P. That's where all the liquidity is in the farm. You will need 10-11% slippage due to the 9% fee for buying, which gets redistributed as shown above.

One last thing to mention. In my last thread, I made a point to say there were a small number of holders. I've now realized we can't really look at this figure since any sensible person will be staking their tokens in the farm, thus would not show up as a holder on BSC scan. So don't be put off by those numbers, those are people who either have dust-amounts of tokens or simply don't know their true potential :)

As always DYOR &amp; this is not financial advice :)

EDIT: The new feature is a coinflip game that burns some of the tokens and transfers some to the jackpot!

t3_mf6fod,Giveback token,one,
t3_mf6fod,"Without any unnecessary advertising I just wanted to let you guys know that on Tuesday a new project start on PancakeSwap. It's called a Giveback token.

It works basically as SafeMoon, but with quite interesting feature, where transaction fees are: 1) redistributed to Charity Wallet, 2) burned and 3) being redistributed to all holders. Every month you can vote on charities to which coins will be passed to (coins, which are gathered in Charity Wallet). Voting mechanism is available on their website.

Comparing it to SafeMoon, this project is kind of similar in terms of tokenomics, but here you have an actual (and quite noble) use-case. It's pre-launch as mentioned (will start in 2 days), so marketing is just getting started. Dev team on Telegram is getting alive and you can talk directly with them to verify it's potential by yourself :)

PS. I was approached by one of project developers, because I was one of the first members of Giveback subreddit. Doesn't look scamy, but of course... Think for yourself. I can't vouch for anything and for me personally it looked promising. But, it's just for me. You have to evaluate it yourself :) No contract etc. is available for now, because token wasn't launched yet (so it's not strange). Everything is just on the way, so... Read and invest early if you like it or just let it slide if it won't convince you :) As always - project like this need traction in the begining.

t3_mexhaw,🚨WAKE. UP. NOW. 🚨🌱$RWN: A decentralised green energy blockchain with the potential to skyrocket! ($1m market cap) 🚀,one,
t3_mexhaw,"Finally a coin with an actual use case. I'm sick of these ""Safe"" coins that serve to pump once within the first 45 minutes and then dump with no chance of ever going back up again.

Wouldn't you rather start investing in coins with the same market caps but with an actual future? A coin that you can invest your money into and know that there's a team posting regular solutions to very real-world problems?

I present to you: 🌱 Rowan Energy ($RWN) 🌱

****

Price: ~$0.8

Supply: $45M

MC: ~$1M

****
Fully public team based in London (strict regulations and a long foundation, no potential for rug pulls or scams!) working non-stop since 2017.

Gaining momentum every day as more and more goals are being hit and investors are realizing that this project is about to take off in the coming months.

Team is very responsive and active in the community. 
No portion of the 45mil max supply was put aside for the team!, so no dumping or large dev sell-offs later on!

Fully functioning real world product.

New roadmap coming.

Impressive investors onboard (Simon Ludlam)

Tier 1 exchange/s coming soon! 

No marketing or overt shilling without any real development, all growth has come naturally and from successful implementations along the roadmap.

****

**What actually is it?**

Rowan energy is the world’s first community led green energy blockchain. Rowan enables domestic and commercial owners of rooftop solar to sell their generated energy to other consumers P2P‬, bringing in the best returns possible for solar and the cheapest green energy on the market. This is done so through the $RWN token, bypassing big energy suppliers and ensuring the customer retains more profit (&gt;70% more). Check out the rewards [here](https://youtu.be/iUltgVryaSI)

V1 going live this week along with marketing!!


****
**The Best Part:**

New homes in the UK will be required to produce 31 percent less carbon dioxide than they do now, which will require better energy efficiency. 

In the vast majority of cases, it is expected that solar will be the most cost-effective way for homebuilders to remain below the carbon threshold.

The new rules are expected to pass into law in the spring of 2021, and they will likely begin to be applied to new building plans starting in the spring of 2022. They are the precursor to a much stricter set of regulations, the Future Homes Standard, to be implemented in 2025 and which will cut permitted emissions by 80 percent.

****

**The Future of Rowan:**

In the near future, Rowan Energy will be partnering with a solar battery company to have their smart miners preinstalled in the batteries. 

This is a massive step in the right direction to facilitate mass adoption. Also, they will partner with another firm that specializes in obtaining energy utility licences. 

All the ground work has been finalised and both the firm and Rowan is now formalising their application following the the Beta testing with over 200 homes which concluded this February, and on the completion of the new rounds of fiat fundraising in March to April 2021.

****

**Can you connect the dots here...? I can and I smell profits. Big ones.**

Not surprisingly, Rowan has four private investment funds who want to come on board. One of which is a VC with very deep pockets that specializes in climate and renewable energy.

There is also no competition in the UK to speak of. 
‬
Closest comparison is $EWT and even that isn’t in the top 100 yet. 

$EWT Price: ~$16 

$EWT Supply: 100m (more than double $RWN’s!!)

$EWT MC: ~$500m 

Easy 500x just to reach EWT CAP 

1000x if it reaches top 90...

****

**The Team:**
CEO, David Duckworth, has significant experience as a network security specialist, engineer, analyst, blockchain and entrepreneur. 

Worked for employers and clients including Deutsche Bank and Aviva. 

The entire team is publicly listed along with their LinkedIn profiles and qualifications, giving genuine support and expertise to the company.
‪‬
People are only just starting to realise the true potential of this gem. Genuine project with a real use case. 1000x potential and beyond!

****

A really great in-depth read on the project and the tokenomics can be found here.  If you read this you will instantly become bullish. 

https://cryptoinparadise.medium.com/rowan-energy-the-bitcoin-crypto-underdog-holy-grail-of-the-energy-sector-1a116a95a2da

****

**Exchanges and Wallets:**

Currently only on 2 exchanges; Probit and LAtoken. 

I’ve used Probit multiple times now and it’s worked perfectly for me, no issues transferring $RWN to the official storage wallet either, found on the Rowan Energy Website.


Never been more bullish! Do your own research on this token and you will be even more confident, there is a serious potential for this token to skyrocket with an actual use case, and have large scale support as it develops.

This project seems to actually have a team behind it, that cares about the community from what I've researched. Don't follow me blindly though and DYOR, but looks like an extreme moonshot.

What is [MozartFinance.io](https://mozartfinance.io/) ?
Mozart Finance is a fork from Goose Finance &amp; astonishing DeFi project running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

Liquidity LOCKED FOR 8 MONTHS
The fact that they audited code before lunch and removed migrator code is what makes this a one-of-a-kind project.

AUDITED BY [@ImmuneBytes](https://twitter.com/ImmuneBytes) - they have worked on various top crypto projects and have a great understanding of DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, Swissborg, Ox protocol, Uniswap etc.

There is common knowledge about migrator code in pancakeswap masterchef contract. With this option, it is highly possible to do a rug pull. Although they might not do it, the code is still present in their contract and this code is exactly how all the rug pulls were done.

Mozart finance has removed the following migrator code from their contract and audit also proves that contracts are safe. You can see the following code is still present in pancake swap’s contract and Github.

Telegram: https://t.me/MozartFinance

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MozartFinance

Their mission is to create a splendid perpetual deflation token that performs like a symphony. Native token PIANO will provide a stable price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. They are not trying to replace the swap &amp; exchange but rather to add value to the system and create a sustainable environment for people to yield farms with high APR.

PIANO token is live on:https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xd46936677b2c1bb696f2b67c55239331e2b7cd42

The team had a bit of a rocky start but they come on top by burning some tokens and taking one for the community
All in all, it's a deflationary token that's getting on the Music NFT bandwagon with an active team and seemingly community and a low marketcap - the kinda thing we've seen get mooned in the past, and after coingecko it will just run and run.

Hopefully because the project is so young but I'll try again.  DMDHANDS is like 4 or 5 days old and they have already locked in a Satoshi Club AMA for the 30th of March.  Pretty bullish for a young coin on the BSC network.  I dunno about you guys but I've bought like 10 shitcoins lately and 8 of them dunked on me.

I will start posting down below the general information of the token and then I will explain why this is a good long-term investment.

\- Redistributed, not deflationary

\- Manual burn schedule of 1m  every 1k Holders

TL;DR

**Deflationary token** 

1% reward to $PBOM holders, 1% of every transaction gets distributed to every holder, straight to your wallet automatically.

1% of every transaction gets burned forever.

2% of every transaction goes to liquidity forever.



**Rocket Drop** 

Stake your $BUNNY or $PBOM and provide liquidity for new token projects, for the new tokens. An incubator platform while you help out at virtually no risk.

t3_mf1vqf,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),one,
t3_mf1vqf,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).

*Here are 32 reasons why:*

***Tokenomics***

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.

***Platform***

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.

***Partners***

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.

***Community***

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/)with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

Let me start by saying first, I have hit big and I have lost on many coins here, many being early, many being late. This is all for fun for me and I have had a blast doing it. This is never **EVER** financial advice and you ALWAYS should **DYOR**. That means checking scan websites for addresses, rug pulls, developers, community, ECT. The chart shows very healthy growth. The bscscan is what truly speaks for itself on this one though bois. 

A fork with COMMITTED, TRUE developers, $SafeX is a community driven project made for all the SpaceX lovers. SafeX employs 3 great functions : Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn In each trade, each transaction is taxed and fee is redistributed to all existing holders. With under 1,000 holders and a community that has steel legs &amp; diamonds for hands. I see this rising along with $ElonGate, $SafeMoon &amp; the other greats we've had this year.

Again, always **DYOR** but after what seemed like space-junk all over my feed, this has brought some light to the cockpit.

t3_mfaccy,10x.gg $XGG Launching Tomorrow The next 100x coin (3M Cap) 1000x Pools,one,
t3_mfaccy," 

**$XGG - 10x gg**

$XGG is the coin for the 10x gg platform. The platform will allow users to enter their respective coins into daily lottery pools with odds of 2/1 to 100/1. Basically allowing users to 100x their coins within 24 hours!

The platform makes a profit from 10% fees received from all pools (apart from the $XGG pool), which will be 100% used for buyback programs and the purchasing of XGG from the open market, causing significant buy pressure considering pools are constantly ongoing every day.

**Team -**

Non-anon team with tons of crypto experience! The coin is built by the **DM Script team** (here's a link to their Twitter: [https://twitter.com/DMScript](https://twitter.com/DMScript))

**Roadmap**

Here's a link to the roadmap: [https://twitter.com/10xdotgg/status/1369788337066713089](https://twitter.com/10xdotgg/status/1369788337066713089)

\- Platform launch coming by end of March (beta already released [http://test.10x.gg/](http://test.10x.gg/) ). Therefore, it may be a good idea to front run the hype before the launch.

\- $250k marketing budget for platform launch including crypto influencer promotions (they work!)

\- Staking coming by end of March with 300% APY.

\- Token listing platform/ICO launchpad (think of the amount of hype new coins could generate if they entered into the pools on launch)

\- Binance smart chain integration

\- Adding other games to the platform to become **the** **main one stop shop for crypto gambling, a HUGE market!**

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Monthly Buybacks

 \- Fair Launch (No Token Sale)

 \- 2.8M Liquidity and marketcap is only 2.5m

 \- Legit Team 

\- $250k Marketing Campaign

 \- ICO Launchpad Q2 

\- 300% APY Staking

t3_mf2l3w,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU

t3_mfdzsq,$Elo still pumping strong - use cases on the roadmap and TikTok Marketing campaign in full force,one,
t3_mfdzsq,"I’ll cut straight to the point: 99% of these meme coins are either rugs, or they fizzle out and die after 2 hours. However, I have found one that actually has some qualities that make it a much safer option than most of these coins. 

1. The owner is Ken the Crypto, a YouTuber. He has put much of his own funds into the coin like everyone else and is working nonstop to promote it and market it intelligently. The fact he’s putting his name on this and doxxing himself is a great assurance that he won’t rug and completely destroy his career and reputation. 

2. TikTok influencer marketing is incoming. We have raised money as a community with some of our initial profits to fund some tiktok influencer marketing (two accounts today with a total of \~4M followers). We are told that the first big influencer video will be dropping within the hour and I have a strong feeling that’ll correlate to a strong influx of new holders

3. Engaged community. Yes I know everyone says this about coins but this seems different. Ken has his built in core audience who already know and trust him, so they’re more willing to go out and shill, and also feel comfortable buying in more and holding. I can’t emphasize enough how different this community feels from the countless that have anon devs who barely communicate with the tg. Ken is actually in there and also live streaming for hours a day to keep us engaged and let us know what he’s working on to promote this.

4. Volume is high. It just launched yesterday and as I type this we are pushing back past our previous ATH from yesterday. Usually if a shitcoin is going to fizzle out it happens relatively quickly. This one is just gaining momentum which makes me think we’re going to see it blow up similarly to a safemars or safemoon level in the coming days. As I’ve previously stated, all of these factors combined with the trust of a doxxed owner can make this soar. 

As always and especially with these shitcoins, DYOR! Be careful and don’t invest more than you can lose. Take small profits as you go as well so you don’t get left holding a bag.

t3_mfaux3,$MOONI - A new gem with high potential,one,
t3_mfaux3," 

I’m bringing to you this new token called $MOONI. First of all please understand that this is not financial advice, I’m just sharing with you a token that I think is going to do a very good job and it’s up to you to decide whether you think it’s worth it or not. Second of all please understand that I have no intention to spam or shill a token that I think is a scam somehow. I did my research on this one and so should you too!

$MOONI is a new token built on BSC and it was launched exactly two days ago (at the time of writing this post). The token is considered to be 100% community owned and it’s aiming to build a powerful community to push the token forward. Approx. 4% of every transaction will go into yield distribution between all wallets and 4% of the trades will be put in the liquidity pool and locked. I have been a member since the project started and I did not see any signs of any scam being planned, nor did I notice anything shady that would make the project suspicious to invest in.

Only thing is that the community is very small at the moment but it’s growing. It really reminds me about the first steps that Safemoon took (I was one of first 150 members/holders in Safemoon and I noticed the same movement in the community as I noticed in MOONI).

Anyways, the token has recently published a new roadmap on its Medium page. According to BSCSCAN, 50% of the tokens have been burnt and liquidity is locked. Website is also up and running and the community is working with other designers to improve the website’s look. Community is very small but it is growing fast, the number of the token holders is not that big since it’s two days old so you are still considered to be early at the time of writing this but token holders are also growing each hour.

Partnerships with other tokens are being considered in the community. A Unirocket bot for the token to view real time prices and buy/sell orders has been created as well. According to the MOONI roadmap, there will be NFTs planned as well as airdrops.

However, applications for token listings (CG, CMC) are not yet proposed since the token needs a specific growth to make that happen (CG &amp; CMC criteria must be met) but it’s worth it to note that the community is planning to apply as soon as they get the required exposure for the token and meet the specified criteria. They are also preparing to release a new marketing plan and working hard on it to make the token more appealing for new investors.

So generally speaking, this token is really promising and the only con I see here is the feel and look of the current website (it’s being redesigned at the moment and a more reliable design will be soon launched). Another thing I did not like is that not all members in the community are active but this can also be settled as new members join and as the token gets enough traction.

Eventually, I would like to say that this is my own research and I’m bullish at this token (I think it would at least do 20x) since it’s giving me Safemoon vibes. I would highly recommend you to do your own research as well before investing in high risk tokens like this one.

I really hope that this token meets my expectations &amp; I also hope that you liked how I researched this token. I will always provide high quality research when available but please don’t blame me if I did any mistake researching this. That’s why I’m asking everyone to do their own research.

Good luck with your future trades!",one,

We’re on our third day now, and the project has once again reached another milestone. **We just reached our $1 target!**

*If you followed my first call, you would’ve made 8x by now. Congrats!*

**Next target: $10**

If you think it’s too late to get in now, you probably said that yesterday too LOL. But seriously guys, it’s a 3-day old project and the team is working hard to develop the project further.

**What else to look forward to, you may ask**

- Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko, and exchange listings
- NFT
- Staking
- A whole ecosystem 🌌👨‍🚀

The team and the community are working really hard to make this project a success long-term. Most of us here are long-term investors. I wouldn’t even worry about the paper hands because we collect their taxes straight into our wallets whenever they sell.

So yeah, give this one another thought and maybe you can ride with us towards our next target.

t3_mfejak,🍈 $TREAT🍈 Yourself At TreatDAO!,one,
t3_mfejak,"With NFTs (and NFT tokens) going through it's hype mania and BSC/Pancake Swap in the limelight due to ETH's anti-retail fees, let me tell you something about 🍈$TREAT🍈, a governance token for a decentralized ecosystem built on BSC giving creators the tools to tokenize their exclusive content into limited SFW/NSFW NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the platform:

TreatDAO is a place where you can mint and sell your private, limited, one of a kind NFTs. Whether you're completely new to the game or in the top .001% of OnlyFans, $TREAT gives creators the ability to create SFW and NSFW content to distribute to their communities on THEIR terms. With $TREAT being completely decentralized, the creators have complete ownership of their sales and revenue, while $TREAT holders have a say in future model spotlights, new features, partnerships, and more! Last week was the initial launch with the release of Alenaxbt's NFTs and 24 hours after launch, over 33 BNB worth of NFTs were sold! Not bad for a community driven project launched just a month ago :)

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the tokenomics:

1m $treat supply.

Currently sitting at a 2.3m mcap.

96% airdropped to the community (1200 total recipients, 300 left at the time of writing this post).

6% dev supply.

100% community provided lp 

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion:,

TreatDAO: 

\- no VCs 

\- 100% community driven and funded 

\- working platform release in under 3 weeks 

\- easy to understand product  

Others: 

\- multiple VCs on board  

\- BILLIONS in funding  

\- no platform or working product after 4 years of development

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not gonna do much TA or PA because its primed in both categories (ATH was $5.34, currently $2.30) but I will say this, this is much needed in DEFI and with the success of the initial launch and being first to market on BSC, I think this is just the beginning for 🍈$TREAT🍈. dYOR.

t3_mf0qpe,OakTree Finance ($TREE) Sustainable Defi app on Binance Smart Chain,one,
t3_mf0qpe,"First off, before blindly shilling this coin, I want to take a good look at what we're dealing with as I believe that there's plenty of merit to be skeptical.

OakTree Finance ($TREE) was announced on this subreddit about a month ago and there was a lot of speculation surrounding rug pulling in that thread. I've been following the progress and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I've been tracking wallet behaviors etc. and tried deep diving into the developers and their transaction history.

**Pros:**

* *Even though it ain't complete yet, they continue to work on their website, adding link functionality and additional content.*
* *Staking was released today as of March 28, 2021.*
* *Continues to add additional partners and verification.*
* *Delivered on every promise for now.*
* *Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to wallet behavior.*

**Cons:**

* *Bots, many bots... bots everywhere, especially twitter.*
* *Situated in Singapore and obscured knowledge about developers.*

**My Thoughts:**

* *If it was a rug pull, they're putting in a huge amount of effort into it and could've done so many times by now already.*
* *Bots could simply be a quick way to launch and get attention. A typical Asian way to gain attention, but in the western world it is frown upon somewhat.*

**Be careful if you choose to invest in this project, I've got some myself, but not more than I can afford to lose.**

**Feel free to debate and do your own research and post/comment your findings. With that out of the way, here's an introduction (Copy/Paste from site):**

# Oaktree Finance

OakTree Finance is a 3rd generation sustainable growth DEFI ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

&amp;#x200B;

**Oaktree.finance** has the potential become one of the largest liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and one of the fastest-growing AMMs and Asset pools in the DeFi market. We want to stand out from the rest of the DeFi sites by building a long term sustainable growth model.

**SUSTAINABLE GROWTH** Fees that are collected are reinvested to diversified external farms generate constant APY which will be used to buy up ACORN/TREE tokens every few days for the benefit of the community.

**ALPHA BURNING MECHANISM** Non native token farms will pay a 4-6% fee upon staking. The 4-6% will be used to purchase ACORN/TREE token and reinvested for its growth.

**UNIQUE LUCKY DRAW POOL** A lucky draw pool will be developed where a portion of participation token will be burn and the majority distributed as prizes.

**DIVERSIFIED VAULTS INDEX** A diversified vaults index will be create to cater to users who want to compound high APY yet diversify their risk. The mechanism allows users to spread their risk to various vaults and optimizers.

**NFT COLLECTION** OakTree.finance will generate its own collection of NFT (Non fungible token) and collaborate with other crypto artist to generate limited edition NFT. Once sold in future the proceeds will be used to reinvest and to burn ACORN/TREE token. We will also develop a comprehensive NFT world consisting of marketplace, arts, characters, land, property, pets etc.

**BSC LAUNCHPAD** We will provide the ability for projects to launch on our site similar to IFO and our presale function.

**FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS** Further developments such as advertisement and games revenue generation will be developed in future.

**SECURITY** Timelock added to contract at launch. Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap).

**Burn** 70% of the deposit fees will be used to purchase TREE and burnt  30% of the deposit fees will be sent to the developer’s address (This will be reinvested into diversified farms and APY use to buy and burn ACORN) Lucky draw (80% paid out as prizes and 20% burn) will be developed shortly. NFT sales in TREE or other token fees will be funneled back to reinvest and burnt Further developments in games will be constructed as we enter the later Epoch.

**Last but not least, I would love to get your feedback on this post. Would you rather leave these on edge projects alone (And out of the CryptoMoonShots reddit in general) or is it fine with some skeptical information and speculation?**",one,
t3_mfcno1,🍑 $PEECH$ 🍑,one,
t3_mfcno1,"
I know your probably reading this and being tired off all these shit/meme coins being pumped 200-500% to then lose 80-90% overnight leaving you feeling with that loss of hope in these projects.

Too many projects are very similar in tokenomics and are all following the trend setter $HOGE$ in being deflationary and a burn % but with no long term plans or community engagement, we can all agree for a coin to perform well long term it requires consistent growth  in holders and a community that truly believe in a project, so in belief that they don’t have intentions of selling.

The problem is admins and devs think that a token will perform well because people just talk in a group chat on telegram and make memes all day long, it works well to pump a coin and sell the dream but then the real holders feel left out when there holdings drop to nothing, killing a project.

Take a look at recent meme/shit coins volume is dropped to nothing and buys and sells no longer occur every 20-40 seconds, more like every 20-40 mins. 

This is where a project like $PEECH$ comes in and hear me out, I will explain why $PEECH$ has a potential to be a great community with engagement on a weekly basis 😌😉 

Here’s the website, fairly nice design and niche for a project that’s less than 3 days old.

25% Of Tokens distributed to the team fairly to help maintain the project long term.📈

🔒40% of the total supply divided into 2 wallets, one is locked for 6 months and one is locked for a week at a time. 🔒

Why is one locked for only one week?  Every week when one of the burn wallets unlock, $PEECH does a live stream and uses a randomizer to decide if we'll burn🔥 up to 5% of that wallet or if we'll send up to 5% of the wallet to one lucky $PEECH holder 🥳.  It's a new fun way to give back to the community!!!

There first giveaway is due 10th of April !🤪

Features like these will maintain the community long term, interaction with the community admins and devs gives every long term holder a sense of faith and security even during the hardest times 😇🙃

As Peach Finance grows, they will be donating to various food shelters across the world in a bid to give back to different communities not just ours ❤️💪🏽

Okay guys, yet *another* speculative animal/meme coin but hey you clicked on it even though it's in the title and flair right? $PANTHER - cool sounding name and good charity cause (so don't read further on if you're looking for some world changing tech, it's a risky play). A lot of these types of coins are generally pump and dumps that die off quickly but some outliers like $HOGE, $SHIB, $WOLFY, and $GRUMPY catch on and grow exponentially due to their amazing communities; I think this has potential to be another one, or at least profitable (we're all in it for the money right?). So to the point, $PANTHER is basically a RFI fork:

**1%** of every transaction is burned, reducing the supply over time.

**1%** of every transaction is redistributed to every holder.

**0.1%** of every transaction is sent to the [Aspinall Foundation](https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/digitalcurrency/), a charity trying to halt the extinction of endangered species.

**WHAT SETS IT APART?** Now here is what sets it apart from most other animal charity coins - the donation to the charity is sent DIRECTLY to the ETH address of the charity EVERY transaction, no ifs and buts, no reliance on humans to donate manually, with $PANTHER it is donated AUTOMATICALLY direct to the charity via the smart contract. The [Aspinall Foundation](https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/digitalcurrency/) is a legit charity but the thing that makes me even more bullish is the potential marketing as the charity has over 120K youtube subscribers and 50k combined instagram/twitter followers. In the end, it all depends on the community on how well this does, it's all speculation at the moment.

**DISCLAIMER:** these are speculative risky plays based on the current trends, you can lose your entire investment, only put money you're happy to lose.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

**What does Aleph.im have in plan for the future?**

Aleph.im has a sizeable agenda for 2021 and some of their notable targets for the year include:

* **GDPR compliance:** Implementing a right to be forgotten feature;
* **Channel sharding:** Sharding allows projects to create their own dedicated cloud clusters allowing channel’s to have accurate control over their scaling capacity. This will prevent performance from being affected by other projects running on Aleph.im; and
* **Wallet integrations:** Integration of wallets across the Polkadot, Cosmos &amp; Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

**Who are Aleph.im’s competitors?**

As a decentralised cloud storage provider, Aleph.im is discussed as competing with Filecoin. However, it should be noted that Filecoin is useful for those wanting to store large files, contrasting to Aleph.im who focuses on supercharging the DeFi ecosystem by allowing its dApps and protocols to migrate the centralised parts of their stack from cloud to decentralised computation and database services. Therefore, it could be explored that they are complementary as opposed to competing. Quoting the developers of Aleph.im: 

“A team could decide to build a dApp with the following stack:

* Smart contracts on Ethereum;
* Database, computing and DID on Aleph.im; and
* Large files such as videos and pdf’s on Filecoin.”

As a decentralised cloud computing provider, Aleph.im finds competition in the form of Akash Network. Akash Network is solely cloud computing and is restricted to the Cosmos ecosystem, where Aleph.im is also integrated into. Moreover, it is a Layer-2 solution which can be overlaid on the multitude of smart contract platforms it is integrated with.

Aleph.im’s comprehensive cloud network has a number of features that other platforms operate independently.

**Where can you buy ALEPH tokens?**

ALEPH tokens are available on a number of exchanges. The majority of the tokens volume goes through KuCoin (ALEPH/USDT), Uniswap (ALEPH/WETH) and MXC.COM (ALEPH/USDT).

As you may be aware, the KuCoin hack that occurred in September 2020 saw the majority of affected projects upgrade their tokens and roll-back these transactions to ensure that token-holders were not impacted. Like many other projects, Aleph.im did the same with their ALEPH token and with the support of the partner exchanges, v1 tokens were swapped out in place of v2 tokens. However, Hotbit did not forward the migrated ALEPH v2 tokens to its customers and continued to allow deposits and trading for the deprecated ALEPH v1 token. Therefore, if you are interested in ALEPH, please ensure that you do not purchase them from Hotbit.

**Conclusions**

Aleph.im appears to look to compete with a number of existing platforms but looks to offer a more comprehensive service where others focus on only one specific. Being easily compatible with a majority of the large smart contract platforms will be a strong addition compared to platforms that are restricted to their existing platform.

There are fair criticisms of the platform's current circulating supply but even at its fully diluted market cap there is significant scope for growth which is always beneficial from an investors point of view.

By way of disclosure, ALEPH comprises 0.5% of my portfolio and therefore I hope you can appreciate that I am pretty impartial to it as its growth will not materially impact me.

t3_mf8cz6,$PEECH - live stream of a randomiser being used to decide burn and giveaway from developer wallet. Liquidity locked for 12 MONTHS!!,one,
t3_mf8cz6,"$PEECH was released yesterday and is only currently available on uniswap. Liquidity is locked for 12 months and the link is below to check it on the web.

$PEECH is a fresh innovative new crypto that interacts with its holders via live stream video burning and giveaway show. Every week the owner, who is doxxed and not hiding his identity, will host a show where he will use a randomiser to choose between 0.01-5%. What ever percentage is chosen he will then burn or giveaway, depending on what category he is doing.

No transaction tax, no need raise slippage. All the burn and redistribution is done through lottery system. So one lucky winner gets a huge sum of $PEECH (could be over $2000) 

I like this because it is original and the guy is honest. I met him online and he has always come through and is a stand up guy. The 12 months locked liquidity is a show of this. He has thrown everything in to this and I trust he will make it a success. 

Price is stabilising at the moment but is still plenty of time to get on before the first live stream and have a chance to win 4 billion $PEECH

As of right now there is only a telegram page, this project has super low exposure, this is my candidate for a moon shot because the holders remains at 200 with supply pretty evenly distributed, I think if the devs push out what they intend to do in a timely manor the price could appreciate pretty easily, what made me like the project is the fact that I’m a front end dev and I’ve never seen a site look the way theirs does it’s pretty awesome, I have some respect for their front end engineer so without further ado I’ll leave some more info down below

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers! This project is super unique and the site showcases its potential as a low cap gem! ATH was around 30$ pretty good price entry right now hope to see you all at the bar! 🍹❤️

t3_mf46qh,"$LOT A fun Token, suffering from Shitcoins",one,
t3_mf46qh,"&amp;#x200B;

Dear Redditors,

hereby I may present to you the coin of my choice. $LOT Lottery Token.

Before you read any further, be advised that this is not just a promotional post, but a reminder to all of the smaller investors regarding shit/memecoins.

&amp;#x200B;

So my journey with this coin started with DxSale, the presale platform you know? That’s flooded with all the food and SAFE coins? Yeah.

So I was trying to get into presale after reading everything about their tokenomics and joining the community in Telegram. Well well, of course everyone says their coin is sold in seconds, but let me tell you as soon as I hit that refresh button, the presale was over. Never had been in a presale before so I thought that’s normal to be honest.

After that the launch on Pancakeswap started and i joined in finally.

The following hours the coin had a healthy chart and a nice and moderate gain of interest.

So far so good, the team started to work on website and all the stuff the people were asking to be improved. Meanwhile the community took action and promoted the coin on several websites as well as reddit. That. Was. Maybe. A dumb move.

Because, here on reddit in the last few weeks, shitcoins and memecoins have rised from their dark underground and just flooded the forums with pump and dumps. Of course people joined this coin aswell after promotion and let it pump a good bit. But after a while all of these people were leaving the coin to join another good pump.

This has caused several good community members to leave the coin aswell.

We thought, okay nice the biggest whales have left and the tokens are spread nice and evenly around the community. But this pump and dump action has led this to a stagnant bottom. People are believing this is just another Safemoon copycat without heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you, the team around Edith, Tim, Noah and all the others are working their asses off pleasing the community, while working on stuff behind the scenes and they are so generous and community driven. It makes my heart tear, that their nice idea of a token that rewards holders gets stomped by shillers and fudders.

Its not a copycat of any coin, the contract was selfwritten and accomplished and I want their work to be worth something.

It is a lottery token, which means there is a 6% tax on transactions, 2% are burned, 2% are delegated to holders and 2% go into the lottery pot. As soon as the pot hits 0.2% of market cap it is paid out to one lucky holder. And it does not ! depend on how much you hold, whales are not having any benefits. Even the smaller average investor has a chance to win the pot. So far the pot has been paid out like every 2-3 hours, unlike $lottery (this coin is probably also well known) where there is only a winner a day and tokens get drawn from holders.

Of course, there is a minimum amount you need to hold but this is only due to safety reasons so you can’t just put 1 coin in few wallets and participate.

There were originally 2.500.000 Tokens released, 50% got burned, 10% got delegated to devs for marketing and stuff (which they are already using to promote their thingy) and 20% got locked into pancakeswap liquidity. That’s brought us 1.250.000 tokens of which there have already been 50k burned. So we are sitting at a max supply (no more minting) of 1.200.000 !

Of course, the use case of the token is in talks and there has been several ideas to further implement the coin in other systems, thus not only being a lottery token.

Honestly, as the token started I’ve won myself and there is a list of winners all the time, they have been all celebrating in the telegram chat like crazy. It was a nice time seeing all this happy faces and everyone was generous, having the time of their lives, because well, its still lottery you know.

&amp;#x200B;

But this has kind of been destroyed buy all this shitcoin shillings, which made me mad as hell.

So if you are kind enough, check out our small subreddit community at r/lottery_token to get all the infos you need or have a glance of what we are doing. All the whales have left so community is the main holder at the moment.

t3_mf3t02,"This is a very unique and interesting project, and is going to be very popular in my opinion. Just launched like 4 days ago, and the entry point is great. Market cap is low low. This project has amazing utility and will explode once the cyber security audience finds it. There has already been a security audit done, and tokens and liquidity are locked. Community is one of the most transparent I've seen, and is very active and professional. This is going to be a GEM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you have the time, here is the AMA that took place in the ""RedRoomTG"" telegram yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So Badchar. The project is pretty complicated yet simple. So lets bite into it in pieces.

What is Badchar, could you start explaining for non-coders where the name is from :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Of course, ""Badchar"" stands for bad character. Bad characters are inhibitors inside shellcodes that don't allow them to run smoothly. Usually, bad characters are found and taken out of scripts that are used in a buffer overflow attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What inspired the project to become what it is. I don't think there is something similar out there

&amp;#x200B;

A: Badchar is a cryptography-focused bsc project. The project challenges users by allowing them to compete in a capture the flag style game where they are rewarded with NFTs and a small amount of bep20 tokens dependent on the difficulty of said challenge. The project's inspiration came from a well-known cryptography challenge group known as ""Cicada 3301"". I was very intrigued by the challenges back in the day and thought that it could be implemented inside this space.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: For people who know Cicada, knows what they can expect from Badchar. But for those who don't know about this - Can you give an example of a ''Challenge'' - Without revealing to much that makes people go on a hunt :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:So, let's say that I have a .txt file and inside this txt file is something that looks like this: flag{this\_is\_a\_flag) . Once users find this document and there is a flag inside, users can then submit the flag to a submission area for points. In this case, it's for crypto rewards. The means to get to this flag vary in difficulty using many different types of cryptography and data obfuscation. Basically the flag is hiding and you need to find it using unorthodox practice :)

&amp;#x200B;

Q:You said the rewards can be in NFTs. Can you showcase one or two of them. (I Am a fan of the designs) but other might have a look to :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Certainly. [https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa](https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa) Here is a look at one of our less rare NFTs that will be used in the capture the flag challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Lets talk about rarity. So lets say one of the NFTs are super rare - How many pieces are we talking?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Right, so rarity is based upon the difficulty of the challenge. Each NFT in the challenge space is one of a kind, the circles at the bottom of the NFT indicate rarity. Think of it as a trading card system. 1 circle is common and 5 is ultra rare. This will indicate value for each NFT. This, however only goes for the challenge NFTs as market NFTs can be up to five of a kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Can people be rewarded in other things than Nfts? you mentioned tokens

&amp;#x200B;

badchar dev, \[28.03.21 18:59\]

A: Correct. The user will be rewarded with a small amount of tokens based on difficulty as well as receiving that challenges respective NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:When will the game begin? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:Great question :) We have a set of 3 challenges being released right after this AMA ends. These challenges are just for fun and will not be rewarding any tokens or NFTs yet. Think of it as a community driven test run to gauge response and how well users preform under the current difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Okay :) Btw. I understand the Audit from Dessert is done - Can you share for people in here to dive into it :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: We encourage everyone to look through this at their hearts content. Dessert Finance did a phenomenal job!

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Cool, so... Lets go to the second part of Badchar. VOID - What is it? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:The VOID is badchar's third party staking platform for long term holders to compound their gains. Details regarding the VOID will be releasing at a later time as it is currently in development :)

&amp;#x200B;

A (cont.):Badchar is in this for the long haul. As you know gorilla, I've been working on this for quite some time and over that time I've been able to work on quite a bit. We have much more NFT challenges coming, An entire RPG game that will incorporate the NFTs, Future partnerships in the works, and Future marketing in the works as well. just think of a video game version of the previous command line style NFT challenges. The RPG game will be able to use the NFTs as ability upgrades, NFT specific playable characters, and hints. This is why the NFTs will become vital to the future RPG game :)

t3_mfe435,$EYE Behodler Liquidity Queueing - Innovative DEX,one,
t3_mfe435,"This isn't a pump and dump aka get rich quick coin. Price hasn't done much over last 10 days which is good as the launchpad is being formed.  I came across a post in the Telegram that leads me to believe the public launch is near (my guess is next month). 

The liquidity queueing beta version was posted https://i.imgur.com/Zuz5Osw.png

Current market cap is about $12,000,000 and price has been between $1-$2 for most of the month. Looking at 4 hour chart it has highest volume in 10 days https://i.imgur.com/xDLhOmN.png and $1.75 has been support for last 4 days as price now attempts to break $2 with ATH at about $2.50

The token is hard capped at 10M supply and will burn on trades on Behodler. Behodler moves to add 100+ tokens in the near future.

You can think of $EYE as like the next 1inch which has a market cap of $600,000,000 right now. Of course we all know about Uniswap and its 14 billion dollar market cap. This makes $EYE at 10 million market cap seem like a steal. 

Main benefit of using $EYE will be cheaper fees. When you see someone complain about Uniswap fees then in the future we can direct them to Behodler which uses $EYE.

For whales who buy a ton to be part of the liquidity. Users are rewarded for time waiting (or staked) in the queue with $EYE tokens on an hourly basis. There is no claiming your reward for staking as it's automatically put into your wallet. There is single-sided pooling so you don't have to do an Eth pair to pool.

Nerd details here https://github.com/WeiDaiEcosystem/LiquidQueue

Right now there are 139,144 $EYE on Uniswap and at $2 that is $278,288. With the liquidity queueing beta coming up which leads into the public launch we could see a nice pump. Who doesn't love lower fees along with getting your rewards deposited straight into your wallet? While knowing $EYE is capped at 10,000,000 and gets burned with use of Behodler. 

Due to being $12,000,000 market cap you will see buying and selling and price bouncing $1.75-$2.15 until it breaks one way. I am guessing up as the platform is unique and if they do offer 100+ pairs with cheap gas and good liquidity then price will go up a lot. With it being a bigger market cap those with dozens of ETH can easily get in and out without moving the price as much as you would in a small cap coin.  

Bonus: $EYE is also closely tied to $SCX [which has been going up](https://app.astrotools.io/pair-explorer/0xf047ee812b21050186f86106f6cabdfec35366c6)",one,

Features: completely anonymous team, no whitepaper, nothing novel just an ERC-20 token, and unclear and unrealistic roadmap

Motto:  To advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter. 

No innovation. No point. No problem!

Why Shit Coin:  To provide whales, traders, and early adopters a pure shitconin experience. Whales will be given preferential treatement such as early private discounted sales, insider information from dev team etc. To envcourage merchants to adopt ShitCoin as a standard for digital payments.

t3_mfi1o8,"Digital Reserve Currency (Ticker name #DRC, not to be confused with Dracula Coin) is an ERC 2.0 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to act as a digital store of value with a limited supply of one billion coins and a zero inflation rate. 

Differentiating itself from major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, DRC does not require mining or staking (proof of work and proof of stake are the two primary ways that transactions are processed) to process transactions specific to the coin itself, but instead relies on the already existing Ethereum network. 

Maxim Nurov, the coin's founder and longtime financial advisor and D.C. cryptocurrency advocate, has said that he not only developed the coin with simplicity and ease of adoption in mind, but that he also intends for it to be as accommodating to any future cryptocurrency SEC regulations.

I finally grabbed a bag.

Website and their first audit look well done. They already have 3 audits done and releasing another one later today and it looks pretty promising.

Do your own research but it's looking like a solid investment. Price action has not pumped yet and it has been a steady incline from 5 to 50 cents and now there's a pullback to 10. Looking like Good entry.

There are only a bit over 1 million in circulation so this will likely hit a dollar with no effort once the people find out and start pouring in.

Currently going pretty wild and was only added two hours ago. The reason its trending is simply because people probably like the name a lot. This seems like a pretty risky one currently just because its a Safe fork but currently it is doing really well on the charts and it might just be worth throwing a few tens at to get a good return from it quickly as its so new. A lot of these people come on here shilling for their coin saying its going to be a great project and it has awesome potential.

It has 1,000,000,000,000,000 total supply and 5,000,000,000,000 max tokens per trade.

The dev renounced ownership, so it's rugpull-proof. **And** no holder owns more than 3%. **The biggest whale has only 2.76%** and that's amazing for steady moonshot rides.

It's on the Binance Smart Chain, so unlike Uniswap moonshots with the insane gas fees, it's feeless to try jumping in on this one.

t3_mex5fp,Bitclout - Decentralised social media. And a little present from me to reddit users,one,
t3_mex5fp,"Hi everyone, I am a long time ghoster on reddit. However after encountering this sweet project here I thought I had to give back to the community and push it more.

Bitclout is being traded with btc. As they both present the same type of revolutionized value.

Bitcoin = a code being valued as money on a decentralised p2p platform

Bitclout = a social platform being value as money on a decentralised p2p platform

And if u think about it, the idea behind the revolution of btc holds in bitclout. It is simply better, more effective and beneficial for these platforms(finance, media) to go through the change into decentralised platforms.

So if u don't know bitclout is a social media based on a decentralised network, where u can purchase ""creator coins"" of every single profile for bitclout token (worth 150$ as of today) . And the profile itself is basically being traded (as if it was a stock or cryptocurrency). Please do notice, it is still in its infant stage, develompent is still ongoing. There are some big partners and investors on this one, and as of right now withdrawing on bitclout is not avaliable, but will be implemented. Those who look for actual moonshots should know they don't happen in a day, so prepare your butts for one hell of a ride. Also advice to read whitepaper.

t1_gsmsjan,No one “missed” Hoge.,one,
t3_mf6zql,$FVT Vote Finance’s revolutionary quadratic voting system will make you stop looking for deflationary assets,eth,
t3_mf6zql,"What does deflationary actually mean?

Typically, we discuss deflation as a positive thing in economics. In that context, it refers to the falling prices of everyday items, thereby providing each individual, or holder, with more purchasing power

But what does it mean in a closed ecosystem in which there is no trade of perishable goods or stable number of holders? **For a coin like HOGE, do deflationary aspects actually improve the tokenomics or equity of the asset?**

Relative to inflationary, it’s not so bad. Inflationary tokenomics typically involve mining or yield farming, **allowing the money printer to go BRRRRRR for your biggest holders** in activities that are not as practical for your smaller holders.

So, with deflationary assets, the decrease in supply increases value proportionally for all holders across the board. Better right?

**Not so fast.** For anyone to win with HOGE, it is dependent on new buyers entering the system. With the price increasing for every decrease in supply, this system still negatively impacts new buyers who the current holders are depending on.

**So, regardless of how you set tokenomics, it doesn’t really matter in the scheme of things.** Whales win. Holders get diamonds hands. Power is centralized.

**But that’s not what we got into decentralized finance for, right?** This is supposed to upend traditional finance and provide everyone the opportunity to properly invest and accumulate wealth.

This is where Finance Vote provides their revolutionary quadratic voting system which can **change the way we handle all governance tokens**. And seriously, I mean **ALL** of them.

If you’re Mr. “I read the white paper” then please, by all means, [go ahead](https://f646e629-e6ab-436e-b4b5-ad62237799a8.filesusr.com/ugd/2f63aa_acbd8518e6cb4b20ae956ef661f85335.pdf). **Written by a team with multiple doctorate degrees on board,** backgrounds in both DeFi and traditional marketing and finance, It’s actually quite the treat.

But if you ape, whitepaper make brain go sad, it basically goes something like this. Finance.vote handles KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures through **ID’s in the form of NFT’s, called Decentralized Identity Tokens, or DIT’s.**

These DIT’s allow you to vote on a variety of measures. However, the more votes you make on different measures, the less power each vote has.  This reduces the power of a single DIT to impact voting more than, say, a person who is really only interested in one issue.

This is important, because voter apathy is real, and just because someone chooses not to vote on a particular issue, it doesn’t mean other people should have more collective power.

Now, this is still pretty easy to exploit. All you have to do is create multiple identities and then you get more votes. I’m sure we’ve all seen this happen *somewhere*.

Without being able to verify identity through some regulatory agency, thus preventing DeFi from achieving its dream of cutting out third parties, there is just no realistic way to do KYC effectively to prevent this.

**So, Finance Vote simply allows you to buy more identities with FVT, but at increasing cost per buy, with supply burning at each purchase to reward all holders.**

While this may not seem like such a smart idea if you’re from a developed country, allowing people to buy votes, it ignores the reality that people will find ways to do so regardless and that, for most traditional companies, and most of DeFi, stocks and tokens are essentially votes you can accumulate.

It also ignores that half of the world lives undocumented, and, without this system, would never be able to vote in finance anyway. And since each additional vote costs significantly more than the one prior, there will be diminishing returns, acting as a much larger deterrent to accumulating power than we’ve seen thus far in *any* system, traditional or decentralized.

Finance Vote has also added true merit-based aspects to this voting system, getting further away from holders simply winning for holding. **They’ve taken their second-layer governance system and applied it to create an entire ecosystem.**

One that I want to highlight is [finance.vote](http://finance.vote/), a market predictions platform that provides a gamified approach for users.

Like how eToro allows you to copy other traders’ portfolios and moves, or Reef Finance ($400M cap) allows you to invest in baskets, or collections of different tokens, each vote on a market prediction gets recorded and is available for other traders to see.

As DIT’s get associated with making correct calls, they become more valuable (and are also tradeable). This is because **the system actually weighs their input more heavily when curating discovery of tokens on the platform.** This seems a fair and merit-based reward for increasing the viability of the platform through correct market predictions.

In itself, this is a fantastic idea and will likely make investors a ton of money if they follow the voting signals which are designed to drown out whale action.

But this is particularly interesting to me as Reef, once again, a **$400M company,** has forged a **partnership with Finance Vote** in order to utilize both their market indicators as well as their voting system.

Think about that. **Think about them being able to license this voting system, which reverses the benefits of economies of scale, the problems of traditional finance which bleed into DeFi, and sets us on a course for equity.**

Forget inflationary, forget deflationary, none of it matters if we just cap off the influence of big power and restore equity in finance.

**At an $8M market cap, Finance Vote is legitimately a contender to be a billion dollar asset.** The functionality of its system is truly second to none, and can redefine the DeFi space and solve so many issues of market manipulation that we’re all seeing.

Oh, and don’t forget that this is just **ONE** part of their ecosystem? You can check out [yield.vote](http://yield.vote/), [influence.vote](http://influence.vote/), [auction.vote](http://auction.vote/). While these are all impressive in their own right, I know you’re chomping at the bit to buy some FVT so DYOR on the rest.

So whether you pick up a bag to get rich from the whale-resistant market prediction system, or because you can see its ability to be a licensing giant partnering with every major DeFi player, just know you’re in for one hell of a ride behind an extremely respectable team helping prove the value of DeFi in solving real world problems.

**Tl;dr: Doxxed and accomplished team partnering with $400M cap projects, with a revolutionary voting system and NFT-based ID’s that will close the gap on the inequities and market manipulation plaguing DeFi so that it can truly replace traditional finance, with a full-utility token that burns supply when spent on minting new ID’s.**

t3_mf16ea,Bogtools (BOG) - a BSC token with real utility,eth,
t3_mf16ea,"Allow me to get evangelical about my love for BOG. If you just want a quick rundown, check the lightpaper at [bogtools.io](https://bogtools.io/lightpaper.pdf), otherwise, allow me to wax lyrical on why this is the best new token on BSC right now. Disclaimer: I hold and stake BOG since day 1 of the project and am still buying and staking now. 

First off, the usecase and tokenomics of this project mean that BOG is absolutely not a typical BSC shitcoin. However, it will revolutionize the BSC shitcoin trading game. Do you love to trade garbage like HarambeDoge Protocol, PonziBomb, SafeBetelgeuse, and RUGIN24? Is your strategy for trading these to get in and out like a thief for a quick 10x before the hype dies or the devs disappear? If so then you'll definitely want to read on. 

Bogtools is a suite of dApps for use on the Binance Smart Chain, centred around oracles that can be deployed for any token on the BSC, regardless of whether they are listed on any exchanges.

The first app, released a few days after launch, was BogCharts. This uses the oracles to display a price chart for any token on BSC. This is neat not only because many projects do not have these until they are listed in places like CMC and CoinGecko, but also because the data shown is gathered directly from the blockchain, instead of an exchange ledger. This gives more accurate and up to date charting than is available elsewhere for BSC tokens, and allows developers of new projects to have an accurate price chart from day one. 

The second tool to be released was a verifiable random number generator (RNG), which uses a cryptographic function to prove that the number has not been tampered with in any way. The fact that this can be audited and proven to be reliably random means that it can be implemented in other projects that require it, such as casinos and lotteries, or anything that requires chance to function. 

The third (and most important) tool is slated to arrive on or before the 2nd of April: [limit orders](https://imgur.com/a/dZgeyzf) for Pancakeswap pairs. This will be implemented on the Bogtools site, and will allow you to create limit buys and sells on assets tradeable on Pancakeswap. This will be tested for reliability on 4 (four) token pairs to begin with, then rolled out to all assets shortly thereafter. Stoplosses will follow shortly after that. This is a huge deal for anyone who trades BSC shitcoins. Currently if you want to trade a newly created token, all buys and sells must be processed manually. ""What if saferug moons while I'm asleep?"" will never be a question you need to worry about again. 

The devs have stated that this can be improved upon in the future to activate upon a variety of specific triggers such as a dev wallet removing liquidity. You will be able to setup an order to sell all of your saferug *in the same block* as the trigger activity takes place. Meaning that you will be able to trade these ponzicoins and rugmoons with **significantly** reduced risk. If you as a reader of r/cryptomoonshots cannot see the immense value in this, then I don't know what to tell you. 

In order to implement these dApps, the user must pay a flat fee (pegged to USD) in BOG. The fees will then be distributed to stakers, used to pay the gas fees, and sent to the development team in order to grow the project. The fee for limit orders will be $2.50, paid in BOG. 

Currently, the token has a 4.5% fee on all transactions. This is sent directly to stakers' wallets. The devs have stated that this will in time be dropped to 0, in line with the rewards from dApp users rising. This is being done with the intention of keeping the staking rewards healthy, and has led to the kind of devoted community that cheers any and all price action because it pays stakers handsomely. Check out the Bogtools Telegram on a day where crypto as a whole is correcting and you will see no panic. 

""So wtf is bogged.finance?” you ask. This is where the project gets really cool IMO. Bogged is an ARG which incentivises users to hold and stake BOG in return for rewards in an ever-evolving game which is currently in its very early stages. The pregame had players coordinating across every social platform to reveal clues hidden inside scrambled audio clips, decode cyphers hidden in promo videos, and scrabble around in Minecraft servers looking for a password, in order to start the countdown to the real game. It really brought out the best in the community and it makes me very excited to see where the game goes. The two material things that have come out of the game so far are the Sminem NFT's and the NGMI token. 

The NGMI token is given to you whenever you sell BOG. This token cannot be traded and is intended as a mark of shame that will forever mark your wallet as unclean. It is speculated that this will have some effects later in the game, and potentially in the governance protocols that will be introduced later in 2021.

Sminem NFT's were available to the first 500 people to claim them. However, you had to stake for 24 hours to get the chance to claim him, and holders of NGMI were barred from claiming. 

To have no NGMI, a Sminem and an untouched stake is considered a huge badge of honour in the BOG community. Who even knows what will come next, but the devs have stated there will be some more features to the ARG coming very soon, in addition to another round of 250 Sminems for those who were unable to claim one last time around. 


So, on to the important questions:

Q: When moon?
A: BOG has its biggest feature being released in 6 days. There is over $250k in the marketing wallet. Confirmed mentions from some major crypto YouTubers coming up imminently. Code is original, useful and innovative. Market cap is still very small at $16m. No presale, fair distribution. I won't say it will definitely moon but the ingredients for moon are all here. Just don't expect a quick 10x overnight, as the liquidity pool is very deep thanks to all of the staking taking place. 

Q: Who are the devs? Do they inspire confidence?
A: There are 2 lead devs, John and Luke. Luke is self-doxxed (socials, face and voice) and John plans to do the same after Bogtools is incorporated. They have done 4 (four) discord AMA's in which they have come across as intelligent, motivated and trustworthy. You can find these on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vFdfDuz9Fqk) and listen for yourself. 

Q: OK, I have BOG. Should I stake it?
A: Only you can decide this. Be aware of the risks of impermanent loss (IL), but also be aware that early stakers have already doubled their stack. It should be worth it if you set and forget, but may not be worth it if you plan on unstaking soon. Ask on Telegram and you will get some well informed, yet weary answers (this makes up a good chunk of the debate on there). 

Q: What is the major FUD against this project?
A: Firstly, that ETH fees will decrease to the level where BSC becomes irrelevant. Devs have answered this by saying that if ETH fees are lowered to BSC levels, they will launch Bogtools for ETH as well. 

Secondly, the question of ""if this is doable, why haven't Pancakeswap implemented charts and limit orders themselves?"" Bogtools has first mover advantage here, and if Pancakeswap was able to do this, they would have done it already. Seeing as their code is not original (it's a fork of Uniswap), there is little likelihood of them implementing this in the near future. 

As of right now, the market cap is $16 million, which IMO is very small for what this project may deliver. This is not a clone or a fork, it's an original and innovative project and a real boon to the whole BSC. It should go far.

TL;DR: BOG gud",eth,
t3_mfbuhw,Why $EBOX will become one of the greats. Very comfortable x10 can be found here.,eth,
t3_mfbuhw,"Sup y'all!   
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves an easy way to get rid of wallet trackers, remain truly anonymous on the public blockchain and more.  
(now that the degens havent clicked on this post because of the title: this is actually a **100x** or more moonshot)

# So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. EBOX has the solution.   
Using the unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

That's a cool idea that will help many newcomers on crypto but as people get more familiar with crypto this problem fades away, and then a new problem arises. Anonymity.

**That is why I actually like this one.**

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:** 

&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Who’s the Team behind 10x.gg?

# Tokenomics, Product and User Adoption, Driver of Value

&amp;#x200B;

* `Token Type: ERC20`
* `Overall Supply:` `1.000.000.000`
* `Current Circulating Supply:  200.000.000`
* `Current Market Cap: ~ 3.5 million`
* `Current Holders (Etherscan): 844`  


The project started without any token sale for $XGG. Currently the total liquidity on Uniswap is over 2.5 Million USDT, what’s quite noteworthy for a new project without any pre sale and such small market cap, whereby 50% of liquidity is locked via unicrypt.   [LINK](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0x123b5a3a816aeb1c901e58bc81937fcf159269fe) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*1st Driver of Value:*  
***The Onboarding of other ERC20 tokens on the platform***

10x offers an opportunity to other companies to join the platform with their native tokens.  
They will be able to apply for token listings and need to pay for the listing services with $XGG.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision.

t3_mfejak,🍈 $TREAT🍈 Yourself At TreatDAO!,eth,
t3_mfejak,"With NFTs (and NFT tokens) going through it's hype mania and BSC/Pancake Swap in the limelight due to ETH's anti-retail fees, let me tell you something about 🍈$TREAT🍈, a governance token for a decentralized ecosystem built on BSC giving creators the tools to tokenize their exclusive content into limited SFW/NSFW NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the platform:

TreatDAO is a place where you can mint and sell your private, limited, one of a kind NFTs. Whether you're completely new to the game or in the top .001% of OnlyFans, $TREAT gives creators the ability to create SFW and NSFW content to distribute to their communities on THEIR terms. With $TREAT being completely decentralized, the creators have complete ownership of their sales and revenue, while $TREAT holders have a say in future model spotlights, new features, partnerships, and more! Last week was the initial launch with the release of Alenaxbt's NFTs and 24 hours after launch, over 33 BNB worth of NFTs were sold! Not bad for a community driven project launched just a month ago :)

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the tokenomics:

1m $treat supply.

Currently sitting at a 2.3m mcap.

96% airdropped to the community (1200 total recipients, 300 left at the time of writing this post).

6% dev supply.

100% community provided lp 

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion:,

TreatDAO: 

\- no VCs 

\- 100% community driven and funded 

\- working platform release in under 3 weeks 

\- easy to understand product  

Others: 

\- multiple VCs on board  

\- BILLIONS in funding  

\- no platform or working product after 4 years of development

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not gonna do much TA or PA because its primed in both categories (ATH was $5.34, currently $2.30) but I will say this, this is much needed in DEFI and with the success of the initial launch and being first to market on BSC, I think this is just the beginning for 🍈$TREAT🍈. dYOR.

t3_meyerf,"\*\***Read the DISCLAIMER first, risky play.\*\***

**Market cap:** 180K

**Website:** [https://panthertoken.space/](https://panthertoken.space/)

**Dextools:** [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xede34a8b57f0cab84dc33e17900e92f52da76e26](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xede34a8b57f0cab84dc33e17900e92f52da76e26)

**Liquidity locked:** [Unicrypt](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0xede34a8b57f0cab84dc33e17900e92f52da76e26)

Okay guys, yet *another* speculative animal/meme coin but hey you clicked on it even though it's in the title and flair right? $PANTHER - cool sounding name and good charity cause (so don't read further on if you're looking for some world changing tech, it's a risky play). A lot of these types of coins are generally pump and dumps that die off quickly but some outliers like $HOGE, $SHIB, $WOLFY, and $GRUMPY catch on and grow exponentially due to their amazing communities; I think this has potential to be another one, or at least profitable (we're all in it for the money right?). So to the point, $PANTHER is basically a RFI fork:

**1%** of every transaction is burned, reducing the supply over time.

**1%** of every transaction is redistributed to every holder.

**0.1%** of every transaction is sent to the [Aspinall Foundation](https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/digitalcurrency/), a charity trying to halt the extinction of endangered species.

**WHAT SETS IT APART?** Now here is what sets it apart from most other animal charity coins - the donation to the charity is sent DIRECTLY to the ETH address of the charity EVERY transaction, no ifs and buts, no reliance on humans to donate manually, with $PANTHER it is donated AUTOMATICALLY direct to the charity via the smart contract. The [Aspinall Foundation](https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/digitalcurrency/) is a legit charity but the thing that makes me even more bullish is the potential marketing as the charity has over 120K youtube subscribers and 50k combined instagram/twitter followers. In the end, it all depends on the community on how well this does, it's all speculation at the moment.

**DISCLAIMER:** these are speculative risky plays based on the current trends, you can lose your entire investment, only put money you're happy to lose. I've invested for the short term and I'm up ~2x so I may dump on you (sorry). Upvotes can be manipulated (for or against) so don't base your views on it.

t3_mfe435,$EYE Behodler Liquidity Queueing - Innovative DEX,eth,
t3_mfe435,"This isn't a pump and dump aka get rich quick coin. Price hasn't done much over last 10 days which is good as the launchpad is being formed.  I came across a post in the Telegram that leads me to believe the public launch is near (my guess is next month). 

The liquidity queueing beta version was posted https://i.imgur.com/Zuz5Osw.png

Current market cap is about $12,000,000 and price has been between $1-$2 for most of the month. Looking at 4 hour chart it has highest volume in 10 days https://i.imgur.com/xDLhOmN.png and $1.75 has been support for last 4 days as price now attempts to break $2 with ATH at about $2.50

The token is hard capped at 10M supply and will burn on trades on Behodler. Behodler moves to add 100+ tokens in the near future.

You can think of $EYE as like the next 1inch which has a market cap of $600,000,000 right now. Of course we all know about Uniswap and its 14 billion dollar market cap. This makes $EYE at 10 million market cap seem like a steal. 

Main benefit of using $EYE will be cheaper fees. When you see someone complain about Uniswap fees then in the future we can direct them to Behodler which uses $EYE.

For whales who buy a ton to be part of the liquidity. Users are rewarded for time waiting (or staked) in the queue with $EYE tokens on an hourly basis. There is no claiming your reward for staking as it's automatically put into your wallet. There is single-sided pooling so you don't have to do an Eth pair to pool.

Nerd details here https://github.com/WeiDaiEcosystem/LiquidQueue

Right now there are 139,144 $EYE on Uniswap and at $2 that is $278,288. With the liquidity queueing beta coming up which leads into the public launch we could see a nice pump. Who doesn't love lower fees along with getting your rewards deposited straight into your wallet? While knowing $EYE is capped at 10,000,000 and gets burned with use of Behodler. 

Due to being $12,000,000 market cap you will see buying and selling and price bouncing $1.75-$2.15 until it breaks one way. I am guessing up as the platform is unique and if they do offer 100+ pairs with cheap gas and good liquidity then price will go up a lot. With it being a bigger market cap those with dozens of ETH can easily get in and out without moving the price as much as you would in a small cap coin.  

Bonus: $EYE is also closely tied to $SCX [which has been going up](https://app.astrotools.io/pair-explorer/0xf047ee812b21050186f86106f6cabdfec35366c6)",eth,
t1_gsmynki,"Of course, it's only one use case of this token. As I also mentioned in the post, for me that use case isn't really interesting to me too.  
What I am more excited about is the escrow service and the *godly* method of sending eth anonymously to a new wallet without too much of a hassle. That's what makes me most excited about this project.",eth,
t3_mf9244,"UpBots - UBXT - Trading bots are coming, whether you like them or not. May as well go with the best.",eth,
t3_mf9244,"**What is UpBots (UBXT)?**

UpBots is a trading platform (crypto initially but traditional markets coming later this year) that caters to literally everyone. 

Manual traders get all the features they'd usually look for - alert, risk management, iceberg, trailing etc with a beautifully designed UX/UI.

  
Those new to trading can take advantage of two types of bots. Firstly, the UpBots - specially designed AI bots that have already proven to have an incredible return rate. These can be rented using the UpBots native token, UBXT.

Users can also pick a bot from the 'supermarket' of user created bots. Traders can submit their own trading algorithms and if they are approved the are given their own bot. Here's the genius part: **Users can rent your bot and you'll receive 15% of any profit a user makes when using your bot.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Think about how many YouTube/Twitter traders there are in the*** [***cryptosphere.***](https://cryptosphere.Now) ***Now imagine they create their own bot and promote it to their viewers/followers.*** 

***Exactly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the company like?**

Really, really good. Like most of you, I join a lot of Telegrams and like to lurk around them before investing to try and get the cut of the developer's jib. These guys are top class. All the directors/CEOs actively participate in the Telegram chat and will happily take time out of the day to DM you about specific questions, concerns you may have. Not only that but they drop updates and roadmap additions constantly. They're also backed by FTX, so they've got financial support in spades.

**Speaking of roadmaps...**

The commercial launch is within the next week or two and they have a whole load of marketing planned around it. Here's just a taste of what's to come marketing wise, straight from the Marketing Director's mouth:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In summary our marketing strategy is now about the commercial launch which is coming up in a couple of weeks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ain't nobody got time for the full plan, BUT I can tell you some of the highlights of what will be happening so you can consider if buying the dip makes sense:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're about to go live with some ads on coingecko  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're launching the commercial version in the next few weeks (details to be announced soon) and we'll have PRs out to all the major crypto/financial news outlets for that  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We are currently reaching out to partner with specific currencies who might like for us to launch a bot trading their pair on binance or FTX. (for example AVAX and many others)   
&gt;  
&gt;and there is a whole bunch of other stuff going on as well, like us just going live on BSC and the marketing for that  
&gt;  
&gt;That will be fun. We have an NFT scavenger hunt type competition for you guys which I'm hoping will be interesting for anyone who likes to game/figure stuff out.  After the launch we will go to more of a user acquisition marketing strat because if we get lots of happy users, UBXT and our tokeneconomy will work all by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, don't - listen instead to ThatMartiniGuy from this week's live stream if influencer's are your thing: [**https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623**](https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623)

And no, that wasn't a paid for ad. I sent a superchat to genuinely ask what his thoughts were on the project.

**In Closing**

Bots are going to become common place in cyrpto with the huge influx of crypto traders joining the space daily. There is no doubt in my mind that UpBots can become the market leader. You can go and test out the product now at [upbots.com](https://upbots.com) and see for yourself. They're streets ahead of so many of their rivals and are still, unbelievably, relatively unknown.

Obviously, as always, please do your own research (to help with that have a look at the following links:

[https://upbots.com/](https://upbots.com/)

[https://demo.upbots.com/](https://demo.upbots.com/login)

Telegram if you have any questions: [https://t.me/Upbots](https://t.me/Upbots)

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/upbots](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/upbots)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for an answer to the question 'What sets UpBots apart from their competition?' Well, aside from EVERYTHING listed above, UpBots is more focused on bringing different kinds of traders and developers together and rewarding them through our UBXT tokenomics as they use the platform. They also lean more heavily towards automation/copy trading by making it possible for their community members, who don't have time/trading skills to still gain exposure to the markets safely and **only paying fees when they make profits.**

I hope this has been helpful and please do shout if you have any questions!",eth,
t3_mfe45t,Radicle (RAD) decentralised code collaboration platform,eth,
t3_mfe45t,"
Summary:

Radicle brings the possibility to store open source code in the blockchain. Currently most of the code of things we use everyday such as other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, among others are stored in centralised platforms such as GitHub. Which has had a history of blocking people from certain countries to be able to develop and collaborate in programming software.

This platform provides censorship resistant platform, available anywhere, and a free platform that uses the already familiarised open source Git. Providing an easy and familiar environment to code developers. They also allow for crowd funded project which is a very good future for many startups.

I hope you enjoyed this summary and I personally see potential on this platform moving forward. As always do your own research.

t3_meyp8l,Alchemy (NFT DAO Creator) My first call was ⚗️ @ ¢0.80,eth,
t3_meyp8l,"#ALCHEMY


####How it works 
Alchemy lets users take any NFTs that meet the ERC721 standard (almost all) and create a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation which owns the underlying NFT(s). The DAO is controlled by the DAO’s governance tokens, able to be freely traded and transferred, creating liquid markets for ownership. All tokens are worth 1 vote each, and so owning a token gives you both governance rights letting you vote what to do with the NFTs as well as claim rights for NFT sales.

______________________________________________
###Core features

####Buyouts
NFTs can be purchased from the DAO directly by simply transferring the ETH buyout for that NFT to the contract, purchasing the NFT from the DAO. The price for each and every NFT can be set to any value by the NFT DAO allowing for targeted prices while keeping the governance token value as the collective value for all NFTs.

The DAO can also set a buyout price for the whole DAO to be purchased. Allowing for speculators to purchase and hold ownership in collections then profit by selling the collection for more later.

####Burning
At any time the governance tokens for the NFT DAO can be burned for a proportional amount from the NFT DAOs Ether balance. This allows holders to redeem their profits after a DAO buyout or to exit assuming some NFTs have sold but theres no liquid market for the tokens.

####Fund Raise and Fund Management
The DAO can issue new tokens for itself to be able to fund raise to purchase more NFTs. By setting a value for the raise and amount to sell, the DAO can mint governance tokens to be purchased by others in exchange for ETH which can then be used to purchase further NFTs to generate more value.

By allowing for the DAO to dilute the stake in exchange for raising funds to the Treasury, more users can join without holders needing to sell, funds can be used to purchase NFTs, fund costs for like marketing or managing the DAOs and create whole Decentralized Autonomous Organisations around the held NFTs owned and managed by the community. DAOs can take the form as their own funds, collectives or even common good pools, owning say Ethereum.eth and letting the DAO allow projects to register subdomains, generate their own fees from leasing domains to donate and to prevent squatting.

####Governance
The holders are able to create proposals to set buyout prices, fundraise, buy NFTs, sell NFTs, transfer/loan NFTs or do any other action that can be done on chain. Proposals are voted on by holders and allow for Decentralized Community Ownership and control. 

_____________________________________________

####ALCH token
Every buyout that happens for an NFT that was owned by an Alchemy based NFT DAO sends a small fee to the ALCH DAO which splits the fee between the ALCH Treasury and to a staker contract. ALCH holders can stake ALCH tokens to earn these fees, which as the usage for Alchemy DAOs grows so will these fees.

####ALCH also controls the Alchemy Treasury, where holders can vote for how the funds should be used to manage and grow the protocol. By allowing for holders to vote as well as have a direct interest in the growth which drives fee revenue, the system incentivizes the best possible uses for funds that will benefit the protocol and the holders symbiotically.


####Distribution
The ALCH supply will be 10,000,000 with the following allocations


2,000,000 Team Multisig

1,000,000 Founder and team allocation

400,000 Strategic Investors and partners - will be moved to a decentralized VC model later

200,000 Growth and Community

400,000 future devs, team and advisors

__________________________________________

####Creator Airdrop

100,000 - 500,000

Airdrop to early users that create NFT DAOs for their NFTs. These users are the base for the ecosystem and need to pay the costs to deploy the contracts aswell as be willing to decentralize their ownership. Based on DAOs deployed, the market and participants, this allocation may continue to be able to incentivize DAOs to be created or allocated to further community growth.


####Community Airdrop

2,000,000

Airdrop to users that hold NFTs. These users are able to take a claim for the governance for the protocol and distribute to the core market that Alchemy will generate revenue from. We have assuned that only .5x NFT holders will claim. So we have set the reward at 2x the amount needed to allow all holders to claim, so if users leave their claim too late, there may be none left. Any unclaimed tokens will be sent to the Treasury.

####Liquidity Providers

500,000
A small allocation to ALCH/ETH LP stakers to allow for liquidity.

####Treasury

5,000,000

2,000,000 after launch once the team doesnt have majority control for the DAO

3,000,000 slowly vested for 2y to allow for continuous cash flow for early growth

• They Have a current NFTs Cards collection of [Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, CZ, Satoshi Nakamoto and Justin Sun]. More will be added it. The dev will be adding new Heroes NFTs such as Elon Musk, Andre Cronje to name a few. After having a big collection ppl will then be able to fight with those NFT cards for tokens.

t3_mf6zql,$FVT Vote Finance’s revolutionary quadratic voting system will make you stop looking for deflationary assets,uniswap,
t3_mf6zql,"What does deflationary actually mean?

Typically, we discuss deflation as a positive thing in economics. In that context, it refers to the falling prices of everyday items, thereby providing each individual, or holder, with more purchasing power

But what does it mean in a closed ecosystem in which there is no trade of perishable goods or stable number of holders? **For a coin like HOGE, do deflationary aspects actually improve the tokenomics or equity of the asset?**

Relative to inflationary, it’s not so bad. Inflationary tokenomics typically involve mining or yield farming, **allowing the money printer to go BRRRRRR for your biggest holders** in activities that are not as practical for your smaller holders.

So, with deflationary assets, the decrease in supply increases value proportionally for all holders across the board. Better right?

**Not so fast.** For anyone to win with HOGE, it is dependent on new buyers entering the system. With the price increasing for every decrease in supply, this system still negatively impacts new buyers who the current holders are depending on.

**So, regardless of how you set tokenomics, it doesn’t really matter in the scheme of things.** Whales win. Holders get diamonds hands. Power is centralized.

**But that’s not what we got into decentralized finance for, right?** This is supposed to upend traditional finance and provide everyone the opportunity to properly invest and accumulate wealth.

This is where Finance Vote provides their revolutionary quadratic voting system which can **change the way we handle all governance tokens**. And seriously, I mean **ALL** of them.

If you’re Mr. “I read the white paper” then please, by all means, [go ahead](https://f646e629-e6ab-436e-b4b5-ad62237799a8.filesusr.com/ugd/2f63aa_acbd8518e6cb4b20ae956ef661f85335.pdf). **Written by a team with multiple doctorate degrees on board,** backgrounds in both DeFi and traditional marketing and finance, It’s actually quite the treat.

But if you ape, whitepaper make brain go sad, it basically goes something like this. Finance.vote handles KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures through **ID’s in the form of NFT’s, called Decentralized Identity Tokens, or DIT’s.**

These DIT’s allow you to vote on a variety of measures. However, the more votes you make on different measures, the less power each vote has.  This reduces the power of a single DIT to impact voting more than, say, a person who is really only interested in one issue.

This is important, because voter apathy is real, and just because someone chooses not to vote on a particular issue, it doesn’t mean other people should have more collective power.

Now, this is still pretty easy to exploit. All you have to do is create multiple identities and then you get more votes. I’m sure we’ve all seen this happen *somewhere*.

Without being able to verify identity through some regulatory agency, thus preventing DeFi from achieving its dream of cutting out third parties, there is just no realistic way to do KYC effectively to prevent this.

**So, Finance Vote simply allows you to buy more identities with FVT, but at increasing cost per buy, with supply burning at each purchase to reward all holders.**

While this may not seem like such a smart idea if you’re from a developed country, allowing people to buy votes, it ignores the reality that people will find ways to do so regardless and that, for most traditional companies, and most of DeFi, stocks and tokens are essentially votes you can accumulate.

It also ignores that half of the world lives undocumented, and, without this system, would never be able to vote in finance anyway. And since each additional vote costs significantly more than the one prior, there will be diminishing returns, acting as a much larger deterrent to accumulating power than we’ve seen thus far in *any* system, traditional or decentralized.

Finance Vote has also added true merit-based aspects to this voting system, getting further away from holders simply winning for holding. **They’ve taken their second-layer governance system and applied it to create an entire ecosystem.**

One that I want to highlight is [finance.vote](http://finance.vote/), a market predictions platform that provides a gamified approach for users.

Like how eToro allows you to copy other traders’ portfolios and moves, or Reef Finance ($400M cap) allows you to invest in baskets, or collections of different tokens, each vote on a market prediction gets recorded and is available for other traders to see.

As DIT’s get associated with making correct calls, they become more valuable (and are also tradeable). This is because **the system actually weighs their input more heavily when curating discovery of tokens on the platform.** This seems a fair and merit-based reward for increasing the viability of the platform through correct market predictions.

In itself, this is a fantastic idea and will likely make investors a ton of money if they follow the voting signals which are designed to drown out whale action.

But this is particularly interesting to me as Reef, once again, a **$400M company,** has forged a **partnership with Finance Vote** in order to utilize both their market indicators as well as their voting system.

Think about that. **Think about them being able to license this voting system, which reverses the benefits of economies of scale, the problems of traditional finance which bleed into DeFi, and sets us on a course for equity.**

Forget inflationary, forget deflationary, none of it matters if we just cap off the influence of big power and restore equity in finance.

**At an $8M market cap, Finance Vote is legitimately a contender to be a billion dollar asset.** The functionality of its system is truly second to none, and can redefine the DeFi space and solve so many issues of market manipulation that we’re all seeing.

Oh, and don’t forget that this is just **ONE** part of their ecosystem? You can check out [yield.vote](http://yield.vote/), [influence.vote](http://influence.vote/), [auction.vote](http://auction.vote/). While these are all impressive in their own right, I know you’re chomping at the bit to buy some FVT so DYOR on the rest.

So whether you pick up a bag to get rich from the whale-resistant market prediction system, or because you can see its ability to be a licensing giant partnering with every major DeFi player, just know you’re in for one hell of a ride behind an extremely respectable team helping prove the value of DeFi in solving real world problems.

**Tl;dr: Doxxed and accomplished team partnering with $400M cap projects, with a revolutionary voting system and NFT-based ID’s that will close the gap on the inequities and market manipulation plaguing DeFi so that it can truly replace traditional finance, with a full-utility token that burns supply when spent on minting new ID’s.**

t3_mf16ea,Bogtools (BOG) - a BSC token with real utility,uniswap,
t3_mf16ea,"Allow me to get evangelical about my love for BOG. If you just want a quick rundown, check the lightpaper at [bogtools.io](https://bogtools.io/lightpaper.pdf), otherwise, allow me to wax lyrical on why this is the best new token on BSC right now. Disclaimer: I hold and stake BOG since day 1 of the project and am still buying and staking now. 

First off, the usecase and tokenomics of this project mean that BOG is absolutely not a typical BSC shitcoin. However, it will revolutionize the BSC shitcoin trading game. Do you love to trade garbage like HarambeDoge Protocol, PonziBomb, SafeBetelgeuse, and RUGIN24? Is your strategy for trading these to get in and out like a thief for a quick 10x before the hype dies or the devs disappear? If so then you'll definitely want to read on. 

Bogtools is a suite of dApps for use on the Binance Smart Chain, centred around oracles that can be deployed for any token on the BSC, regardless of whether they are listed on any exchanges.

The first app, released a few days after launch, was BogCharts. This uses the oracles to display a price chart for any token on BSC. This is neat not only because many projects do not have these until they are listed in places like CMC and CoinGecko, but also because the data shown is gathered directly from the blockchain, instead of an exchange ledger. This gives more accurate and up to date charting than is available elsewhere for BSC tokens, and allows developers of new projects to have an accurate price chart from day one. 

The second tool to be released was a verifiable random number generator (RNG), which uses a cryptographic function to prove that the number has not been tampered with in any way. The fact that this can be audited and proven to be reliably random means that it can be implemented in other projects that require it, such as casinos and lotteries, or anything that requires chance to function. 

The third (and most important) tool is slated to arrive on or before the 2nd of April: [limit orders](https://imgur.com/a/dZgeyzf) for Pancakeswap pairs. This will be implemented on the Bogtools site, and will allow you to create limit buys and sells on assets tradeable on Pancakeswap. This will be tested for reliability on 4 (four) token pairs to begin with, then rolled out to all assets shortly thereafter. Stoplosses will follow shortly after that. This is a huge deal for anyone who trades BSC shitcoins. Currently if you want to trade a newly created token, all buys and sells must be processed manually. ""What if saferug moons while I'm asleep?"" will never be a question you need to worry about again. 

The devs have stated that this can be improved upon in the future to activate upon a variety of specific triggers such as a dev wallet removing liquidity. You will be able to setup an order to sell all of your saferug *in the same block* as the trigger activity takes place. Meaning that you will be able to trade these ponzicoins and rugmoons with **significantly** reduced risk. If you as a reader of r/cryptomoonshots cannot see the immense value in this, then I don't know what to tell you. 

In order to implement these dApps, the user must pay a flat fee (pegged to USD) in BOG. The fees will then be distributed to stakers, used to pay the gas fees, and sent to the development team in order to grow the project. The fee for limit orders will be $2.50, paid in BOG. 

Currently, the token has a 4.5% fee on all transactions. This is sent directly to stakers' wallets. The devs have stated that this will in time be dropped to 0, in line with the rewards from dApp users rising. This is being done with the intention of keeping the staking rewards healthy, and has led to the kind of devoted community that cheers any and all price action because it pays stakers handsomely. Check out the Bogtools Telegram on a day where crypto as a whole is correcting and you will see no panic. 

""So wtf is bogged.finance?” you ask. This is where the project gets really cool IMO. Bogged is an ARG which incentivises users to hold and stake BOG in return for rewards in an ever-evolving game which is currently in its very early stages. The pregame had players coordinating across every social platform to reveal clues hidden inside scrambled audio clips, decode cyphers hidden in promo videos, and scrabble around in Minecraft servers looking for a password, in order to start the countdown to the real game. It really brought out the best in the community and it makes me very excited to see where the game goes. The two material things that have come out of the game so far are the Sminem NFT's and the NGMI token. 

The NGMI token is given to you whenever you sell BOG. This token cannot be traded and is intended as a mark of shame that will forever mark your wallet as unclean. It is speculated that this will have some effects later in the game, and potentially in the governance protocols that will be introduced later in 2021.

Sminem NFT's were available to the first 500 people to claim them. However, you had to stake for 24 hours to get the chance to claim him, and holders of NGMI were barred from claiming. 

To have no NGMI, a Sminem and an untouched stake is considered a huge badge of honour in the BOG community. Who even knows what will come next, but the devs have stated there will be some more features to the ARG coming very soon, in addition to another round of 250 Sminems for those who were unable to claim one last time around. 


So, on to the important questions:

Q: When moon?
A: BOG has its biggest feature being released in 6 days. There is over $250k in the marketing wallet. Confirmed mentions from some major crypto YouTubers coming up imminently. Code is original, useful and innovative. Market cap is still very small at $16m. No presale, fair distribution. I won't say it will definitely moon but the ingredients for moon are all here. Just don't expect a quick 10x overnight, as the liquidity pool is very deep thanks to all of the staking taking place. 

Q: Who are the devs? Do they inspire confidence?
A: There are 2 lead devs, John and Luke. Luke is self-doxxed (socials, face and voice) and John plans to do the same after Bogtools is incorporated. They have done 4 (four) discord AMA's in which they have come across as intelligent, motivated and trustworthy. You can find these on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vFdfDuz9Fqk) and listen for yourself. 

Q: OK, I have BOG. Should I stake it?
A: Only you can decide this. Be aware of the risks of impermanent loss (IL), but also be aware that early stakers have already doubled their stack. It should be worth it if you set and forget, but may not be worth it if you plan on unstaking soon. Ask on Telegram and you will get some well informed, yet weary answers (this makes up a good chunk of the debate on there). 

Q: What is the major FUD against this project?
A: Firstly, that ETH fees will decrease to the level where BSC becomes irrelevant. Devs have answered this by saying that if ETH fees are lowered to BSC levels, they will launch Bogtools for ETH as well. 

Secondly, the question of ""if this is doable, why haven't Pancakeswap implemented charts and limit orders themselves?"" Bogtools has first mover advantage here, and if Pancakeswap was able to do this, they would have done it already. Seeing as their code is not original (it's a fork of Uniswap), there is little likelihood of them implementing this in the near future. 

As of right now, the market cap is $16 million, which IMO is very small for what this project may deliver. This is not a clone or a fork, it's an original and innovative project and a real boon to the whole BSC. It should go far.

TL;DR: BOG gud",uniswap,
t3_mfbuhw,Why $EBOX will become one of the greats. Very comfortable x10 can be found here.,uniswap,
t3_mfbuhw,"Sup y'all!   
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves an easy way to get rid of wallet trackers, remain truly anonymous on the public blockchain and more.  
(now that the degens havent clicked on this post because of the title: this is actually a **100x** or more moonshot)

# So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. EBOX has the solution.   
Using the unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

That's a cool idea that will help many newcomers on crypto but as people get more familiar with crypto this problem fades away, and then a new problem arises. Anonymity.

**That is why I actually like this one.**

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:** 

&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

t3_mfb4ph,The Reason why $XGG have 100x Potential,uniswap,
t3_mfb4ph,"Before I start, let me point out that this post is no financial advice.  
Everyone should always do research on their own before investing money. 

This is a deep analysis, so if you don't like to read much, this might not be for you.  
In my opinion 10x is one of the most innovative crypto projects with an actual use case and  
it probably won’t take long for them to establish themselves in a rapidly growing market.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Who’s the Team behind 10x.gg?

# Tokenomics, Product and User Adoption, Driver of Value

&amp;#x200B;

* `Token Type: ERC20`
* `Overall Supply:` `1.000.000.000`
* `Current Circulating Supply:  200.000.000`
* `Current Market Cap: ~ 3.5 million`
* `Current Holders (Etherscan): 844`  


The project started without any token sale for $XGG. Currently the total liquidity on Uniswap is over 2.5 Million USDT, what’s quite noteworthy for a new project without any pre sale and such small market cap, whereby 50% of liquidity is locked via unicrypt.   [LINK](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0x123b5a3a816aeb1c901e58bc81937fcf159269fe) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*1st Driver of Value:*  
***The Onboarding of other ERC20 tokens on the platform***

10x offers an opportunity to other companies to join the platform with their native tokens.  
They will be able to apply for token listings and need to pay for the listing services with $XGG.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision. 

:) cheerz

This project seems to actually have a team behind it, that cares about the community from what I've researched. Don't follow me blindly though and DYOR, but looks like an extreme moonshot.

What is [MozartFinance.io](https://mozartfinance.io/) ?
Mozart Finance is a fork from Goose Finance &amp; astonishing DeFi project running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

Liquidity LOCKED FOR 8 MONTHS
The fact that they audited code before lunch and removed migrator code is what makes this a one-of-a-kind project.

AUDITED BY [@ImmuneBytes](https://twitter.com/ImmuneBytes) - they have worked on various top crypto projects and have a great understanding of DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, Swissborg, Ox protocol, Uniswap etc.

There is common knowledge about migrator code in pancakeswap masterchef contract. With this option, it is highly possible to do a rug pull. Although they might not do it, the code is still present in their contract and this code is exactly how all the rug pulls were done.

Mozart finance has removed the following migrator code from their contract and audit also proves that contracts are safe. You can see the following code is still present in pancake swap’s contract and Github.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MozartFinance

Their mission is to create a splendid perpetual deflation token that performs like a symphony. Native token PIANO will provide a stable price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. They are not trying to replace the swap &amp; exchange but rather to add value to the system and create a sustainable environment for people to yield farms with high APR.

PIANO token is live on:https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xd46936677b2c1bb696f2b67c55239331e2b7cd42

The team had a bit of a rocky start but they come on top by burning some tokens and taking one for the community
All in all, it's a deflationary token that's getting on the Music NFT bandwagon with an active team and seemingly community and a low marketcap - the kinda thing we've seen get mooned in the past, and after coingecko it will just run and run.

t3_mf2l3w,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Backed By Binance Cloud,uniswap,
t3_mf2l3w,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

Also, XVG recognized and promoted Mandala: [https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734)

Features of Mandala Exchange:

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU
* CCXT, CMC, and gecko within weeks
* Fiat onramp soon
* Native Token MDX - trading fee discounts and future utility
* Will list additional tokens not found on Binance starting very soon

t3_mfcno1,"
I know your probably reading this and being tired off all these shit/meme coins being pumped 200-500% to then lose 80-90% overnight leaving you feeling with that loss of hope in these projects.

Too many projects are very similar in tokenomics and are all following the trend setter $HOGE$ in being deflationary and a burn % but with no long term plans or community engagement, we can all agree for a coin to perform well long term it requires consistent growth  in holders and a community that truly believe in a project, so in belief that they don’t have intentions of selling.

The problem is admins and devs think that a token will perform well because people just talk in a group chat on telegram and make memes all day long, it works well to pump a coin and sell the dream but then the real holders feel left out when there holdings drop to nothing, killing a project.

Take a look at recent meme/shit coins volume is dropped to nothing and buys and sells no longer occur every 20-40 seconds, more like every 20-40 mins. 

This is where a project like $PEECH$ comes in and hear me out, I will explain why $PEECH$ has a potential to be a great community with engagement on a weekly basis 😌😉 

Here’s the website, fairly nice design and niche for a project that’s less than 3 days old.

🔒All liquidity locked yep 100% of it🔒

25% Of Tokens distributed to the team fairly to help maintain the project long term.📈

🔒40% of the total supply divided into 2 wallets, one is locked for 6 months and one is locked for a week at a time. 🔒

Why is one locked for only one week?  Every week when one of the burn wallets unlock, $PEECH does a live stream and uses a randomizer to decide if we'll burn🔥 up to 5% of that wallet or if we'll send up to 5% of the wallet to one lucky $PEECH holder 🥳.  It's a new fun way to give back to the community!!!

There first giveaway is due 10th of April !🤪

Features like these will maintain the community long term, interaction with the community admins and devs gives every long term holder a sense of faith and security even during the hardest times 😇🙃

As Peach Finance grows, they will be donating to various food shelters across the world in a bid to give back to different communities not just ours ❤️💪🏽

t3_mfan69,"Aleph.im (""ALEPH"") - Introductory write-up",uniswap,
t3_mfan69,"**What is Aleph.im?**

Aleph.im is a cross-chain network featuring decentralised cloud storage, cloud computing and a decentralised identity framework. Note that Aleph.im is not a blockchain but a decentralised network which has cross-chain compatibility with a number of smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos (full list can be found at: [https://aleph.im/#/chains](https://aleph.im/#/chains)). 

The developers of Aleph.im state that Aleph.im’s core mission is to help support dApps and protocols in achieving a fully decentralised architecture. This is done by providing decentralised databases with accompanying storage, computation and a decentralised identification framework.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

**What does Aleph.im have in plan for the future?**

Aleph.im has a sizeable agenda for 2021 and some of their notable targets for the year include:

* **GDPR compliance:** Implementing a right to be forgotten feature;
* **Channel sharding:** Sharding allows projects to create their own dedicated cloud clusters allowing channel’s to have accurate control over their scaling capacity. This will prevent performance from being affected by other projects running on Aleph.im; and
* **Wallet integrations:** Integration of wallets across the Polkadot, Cosmos &amp; Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

**Who are Aleph.im’s competitors?**

As a decentralised cloud storage provider, Aleph.im is discussed as competing with Filecoin. However, it should be noted that Filecoin is useful for those wanting to store large files, contrasting to Aleph.im who focuses on supercharging the DeFi ecosystem by allowing its dApps and protocols to migrate the centralised parts of their stack from cloud to decentralised computation and database services. Therefore, it could be explored that they are complementary as opposed to competing. Quoting the developers of Aleph.im: 

“A team could decide to build a dApp with the following stack:

* Smart contracts on Ethereum;
* Database, computing and DID on Aleph.im; and
* Large files such as videos and pdf’s on Filecoin.”

As a decentralised cloud computing provider, Aleph.im finds competition in the form of Akash Network. Akash Network is solely cloud computing and is restricted to the Cosmos ecosystem, where Aleph.im is also integrated into. Moreover, it is a Layer-2 solution which can be overlaid on the multitude of smart contract platforms it is integrated with.

Aleph.im’s comprehensive cloud network has a number of features that other platforms operate independently.

**Where can you buy ALEPH tokens?**

ALEPH tokens are available on a number of exchanges. The majority of the tokens volume goes through KuCoin (ALEPH/USDT), Uniswap (ALEPH/WETH) and MXC.COM (ALEPH/USDT).

As you may be aware, the KuCoin hack that occurred in September 2020 saw the majority of affected projects upgrade their tokens and roll-back these transactions to ensure that token-holders were not impacted. Like many other projects, Aleph.im did the same with their ALEPH token and with the support of the partner exchanges, v1 tokens were swapped out in place of v2 tokens. However, Hotbit did not forward the migrated ALEPH v2 tokens to its customers and continued to allow deposits and trading for the deprecated ALEPH v1 token. Therefore, if you are interested in ALEPH, please ensure that you do not purchase them from Hotbit.

**Conclusions**

Aleph.im appears to look to compete with a number of existing platforms but looks to offer a more comprehensive service where others focus on only one specific. Being easily compatible with a majority of the large smart contract platforms will be a strong addition compared to platforms that are restricted to their existing platform.

There are fair criticisms of the platform's current circulating supply but even at its fully diluted market cap there is significant scope for growth which is always beneficial from an investors point of view.

By way of disclosure, ALEPH comprises 0.5% of my portfolio and therefore I hope you can appreciate that I am pretty impartial to it as its growth will not materially impact me.

I have currently run through my list and don't have any new names to review and potentially write a post on. If you have any names on your list that you would like me to research and write on - please do let me know.

Otherwise, this will be the completion of a dozen moonshots in 3 months and I'll take a short break to recuperate.

t3_mf8cz6,$PEECH - live stream of a randomiser being used to decide burn and giveaway from developer wallet. Liquidity locked for 12 MONTHS!!,uniswap,
t3_mf8cz6,"$PEECH was released yesterday and is only currently available on uniswap. Liquidity is locked for 12 months and the link is below to check it on the web.

$PEECH is a fresh innovative new crypto that interacts with its holders via live stream video burning and giveaway show. Every week the owner, who is doxxed and not hiding his identity, will host a show where he will use a randomiser to choose between 0.01-5%. What ever percentage is chosen he will then burn or giveaway, depending on what category he is doing.

No transaction tax, no need raise slippage. All the burn and redistribution is done through lottery system. So one lucky winner gets a huge sum of $PEECH (could be over $2000) 

I like this because it is original and the guy is honest. I met him online and he has always come through and is a stand up guy. The 12 months locked liquidity is a show of this. He has thrown everything in to this and I trust he will make it a success. 

Price is stabilising at the moment but is still plenty of time to get on before the first live stream and have a chance to win 4 billion $PEECH

The project is called Cocktailbar.finance $COC

COC supply: 50,000 

Mojitos supply: 5000

Market Cap: $351,000

Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cocktailbar

As of right now there is only a telegram page, this project has super low exposure, this is my candidate for a moon shot because the holders remains at 200 with supply pretty evenly distributed, I think if the devs push out what they intend to do in a timely manor the price could appreciate pretty easily, what made me like the project is the fact that I’m a front end dev and I’ve never seen a site look the way theirs does it’s pretty awesome, I have some respect for their front end engineer so without further ado I’ll leave some more info down below

Site: https://cocktailbar.finance
Price COC: 7.00$ 
Market cap: 353,000$ FDV 
“not counting tokens burnt”

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers! This project is super unique and the site showcases its potential as a low cap gem! ATH was around 30$ pretty good price entry right now hope to see you all at the bar! 🍹❤️

t3_mfe435,$EYE Behodler Liquidity Queueing - Innovative DEX,uniswap,
t3_mfe435,"This isn't a pump and dump aka get rich quick coin. Price hasn't done much over last 10 days which is good as the launchpad is being formed.  I came across a post in the Telegram that leads me to believe the public launch is near (my guess is next month). 

The liquidity queueing beta version was posted https://i.imgur.com/Zuz5Osw.png

Current market cap is about $12,000,000 and price has been between $1-$2 for most of the month. Looking at 4 hour chart it has highest volume in 10 days https://i.imgur.com/xDLhOmN.png and $1.75 has been support for last 4 days as price now attempts to break $2 with ATH at about $2.50

The token is hard capped at 10M supply and will burn on trades on Behodler. Behodler moves to add 100+ tokens in the near future.

You can think of $EYE as like the next 1inch which has a market cap of $600,000,000 right now. Of course we all know about Uniswap and its 14 billion dollar market cap. This makes $EYE at 10 million market cap seem like a steal. 

Main benefit of using $EYE will be cheaper fees. When you see someone complain about Uniswap fees then in the future we can direct them to Behodler which uses $EYE.

For whales who buy a ton to be part of the liquidity. Users are rewarded for time waiting (or staked) in the queue with $EYE tokens on an hourly basis. There is no claiming your reward for staking as it's automatically put into your wallet. There is single-sided pooling so you don't have to do an Eth pair to pool.

Nerd details here https://github.com/WeiDaiEcosystem/LiquidQueue

Right now there are 139,144 $EYE on Uniswap and at $2 that is $278,288. With the liquidity queueing beta coming up which leads into the public launch we could see a nice pump. Who doesn't love lower fees along with getting your rewards deposited straight into your wallet? While knowing $EYE is capped at 10,000,000 and gets burned with use of Behodler. 

Due to being $12,000,000 market cap you will see buying and selling and price bouncing $1.75-$2.15 until it breaks one way. I am guessing up as the platform is unique and if they do offer 100+ pairs with cheap gas and good liquidity then price will go up a lot. With it being a bigger market cap those with dozens of ETH can easily get in and out without moving the price as much as you would in a small cap coin.  

Bonus: $EYE is also closely tied to $SCX [which has been going up](https://app.astrotools.io/pair-explorer/0xf047ee812b21050186f86106f6cabdfec35366c6)",uniswap,

Symbol: SHIT

Supply: 1 trillion

Features: completely anonymous team, no whitepaper, nothing novel just an ERC-20 token, and unclear and unrealistic roadmap

Motto:  To advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter. 

No innovation. No point. No problem!

Why Shit Coin:  To provide whales, traders, and early adopters a pure shitconin experience. Whales will be given preferential treatement such as early private discounted sales, insider information from dev team etc. To envcourage merchants to adopt ShitCoin as a standard for digital payments. We will ask them nicely with a very well written letter.

It has 1,000,000,000,000,000 total supply and 5,000,000,000,000 max tokens per trade.

The dev renounced ownership, so it's rugpull-proof. **And** no holder owns more than 3%. **The biggest whale has only 2.76%** and that's amazing for steady moonshot rides.

It's on the Binance Smart Chain, so unlike Uniswap moonshots with the insane gas fees, it's feeless to try jumping in on this one.

• They Have a current NFTs Cards collection of [Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, CZ, Satoshi Nakamoto and Justin Sun]. More will be added it. The dev will be adding new Heroes NFTs such as Elon Musk, Andre Cronje to name a few. After having a big collection ppl will then be able to fight with those NFT cards for tokens.

t3_mfbypx,"Vether: A strictly-scarce Ethereum-based asset 
Designed to be a store-of-value with properties of strict scarcity, unforgeable costliness and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics characteristics of Bitcoin, where miners compete to expend capital to acquire newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins. Instead of expending capital, Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain. As a result, all units of Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value.  NO PREMINE / NO FUNDS RAISED

Vader Protocol (Not deployed yet)
Capital Efficient Liquidity Protocol combining collateralized stablecoin with Impermanent Loss Protection, Slip Based Fees and Lending platform.
Vader is built on top of a fair distribution mechanism of Proof of Value from Vether

t3_mfcb4k,Missed $Hoge/SafeMoon? Check out $DOGEY 🐶,uniswap,
t3_mfcb4k,"If you missed the recent growth of $Hoge/$SafeMoon, then check out DOGEY!

I just found this new memecoin ($DOGEY) with HUGE potential, it could easily 100x in price! Personally just aped in 🚀🚀🚀

Why I think this is a solid coin 👇

1. Stealth-launched Uniswap coin with a marketcap literally in the thousands, as of now.
2. NFT coin, and NFTs created by emerging/well-known artists for Dogey will have profits donated to charity
3. Professional looking website with all links working &amp; great design
4. Token buyback/burn most likely coming in early April according to the team in Telegram
5. Simple tokenomics - 10 billion supply (fixed), 1% reserved for treasury

The team has also stated that they're in talks with animal shelters in the United States, and will soon reach an agreement around mid-Q2 for the release of NFTs to directly support the shelter and its animals. 

Looks like this could be a huge opportunity. Make sure to check it out!

t3_mf16ea,Bogtools (BOG) - a BSC token with real utility,moon,
t3_mf16ea,"Allow me to get evangelical about my love for BOG. If you just want a quick rundown, check the lightpaper at [bogtools.io](https://bogtools.io/lightpaper.pdf), otherwise, allow me to wax lyrical on why this is the best new token on BSC right now. Disclaimer: I hold and stake BOG since day 1 of the project and am still buying and staking now. 

First off, the usecase and tokenomics of this project mean that BOG is absolutely not a typical BSC shitcoin. However, it will revolutionize the BSC shitcoin trading game. Do you love to trade garbage like HarambeDoge Protocol, PonziBomb, SafeBetelgeuse, and RUGIN24? Is your strategy for trading these to get in and out like a thief for a quick 10x before the hype dies or the devs disappear? If so then you'll definitely want to read on. 

Bogtools is a suite of dApps for use on the Binance Smart Chain, centred around oracles that can be deployed for any token on the BSC, regardless of whether they are listed on any exchanges.

The first app, released a few days after launch, was BogCharts. This uses the oracles to display a price chart for any token on BSC. This is neat not only because many projects do not have these until they are listed in places like CMC and CoinGecko, but also because the data shown is gathered directly from the blockchain, instead of an exchange ledger. This gives more accurate and up to date charting than is available elsewhere for BSC tokens, and allows developers of new projects to have an accurate price chart from day one. 

The second tool to be released was a verifiable random number generator (RNG), which uses a cryptographic function to prove that the number has not been tampered with in any way. The fact that this can be audited and proven to be reliably random means that it can be implemented in other projects that require it, such as casinos and lotteries, or anything that requires chance to function. 

The third (and most important) tool is slated to arrive on or before the 2nd of April: [limit orders](https://imgur.com/a/dZgeyzf) for Pancakeswap pairs. This will be implemented on the Bogtools site, and will allow you to create limit buys and sells on assets tradeable on Pancakeswap. This will be tested for reliability on 4 (four) token pairs to begin with, then rolled out to all assets shortly thereafter. Stoplosses will follow shortly after that. This is a huge deal for anyone who trades BSC shitcoins. Currently if you want to trade a newly created token, all buys and sells must be processed manually. ""What if saferug moons while I'm asleep?"" will never be a question you need to worry about again. 

The devs have stated that this can be improved upon in the future to activate upon a variety of specific triggers such as a dev wallet removing liquidity. You will be able to setup an order to sell all of your saferug *in the same block* as the trigger activity takes place. Meaning that you will be able to trade these ponzicoins and rugmoons with **significantly** reduced risk. If you as a reader of r/cryptomoonshots cannot see the immense value in this, then I don't know what to tell you. 

In order to implement these dApps, the user must pay a flat fee (pegged to USD) in BOG. The fees will then be distributed to stakers, used to pay the gas fees, and sent to the development team in order to grow the project. The fee for limit orders will be $2.50, paid in BOG. 

Currently, the token has a 4.5% fee on all transactions. This is sent directly to stakers' wallets. The devs have stated that this will in time be dropped to 0, in line with the rewards from dApp users rising. This is being done with the intention of keeping the staking rewards healthy, and has led to the kind of devoted community that cheers any and all price action because it pays stakers handsomely. Check out the Bogtools Telegram on a day where crypto as a whole is correcting and you will see no panic. 

""So wtf is bogged.finance?” you ask. This is where the project gets really cool IMO. Bogged is an ARG which incentivises users to hold and stake BOG in return for rewards in an ever-evolving game which is currently in its very early stages. The pregame had players coordinating across every social platform to reveal clues hidden inside scrambled audio clips, decode cyphers hidden in promo videos, and scrabble around in Minecraft servers looking for a password, in order to start the countdown to the real game. It really brought out the best in the community and it makes me very excited to see where the game goes. The two material things that have come out of the game so far are the Sminem NFT's and the NGMI token. 

The NGMI token is given to you whenever you sell BOG. This token cannot be traded and is intended as a mark of shame that will forever mark your wallet as unclean. It is speculated that this will have some effects later in the game, and potentially in the governance protocols that will be introduced later in 2021.

Sminem NFT's were available to the first 500 people to claim them. However, you had to stake for 24 hours to get the chance to claim him, and holders of NGMI were barred from claiming. 

To have no NGMI, a Sminem and an untouched stake is considered a huge badge of honour in the BOG community. Who even knows what will come next, but the devs have stated there will be some more features to the ARG coming very soon, in addition to another round of 250 Sminems for those who were unable to claim one last time around. 


So, on to the important questions:

Q: When moon?
A: BOG has its biggest feature being released in 6 days. There is over $250k in the marketing wallet. Confirmed mentions from some major crypto YouTubers coming up imminently. Code is original, useful and innovative. Market cap is still very small at $16m. No presale, fair distribution. I won't say it will definitely moon but the ingredients for moon are all here. Just don't expect a quick 10x overnight, as the liquidity pool is very deep thanks to all of the staking taking place. 

Q: Who are the devs? Do they inspire confidence?
A: There are 2 lead devs, John and Luke. Luke is self-doxxed (socials, face and voice) and John plans to do the same after Bogtools is incorporated. They have done 4 (four) discord AMA's in which they have come across as intelligent, motivated and trustworthy. You can find these on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vFdfDuz9Fqk) and listen for yourself. 

Q: OK, I have BOG. Should I stake it?
A: Only you can decide this. Be aware of the risks of impermanent loss (IL), but also be aware that early stakers have already doubled their stack. It should be worth it if you set and forget, but may not be worth it if you plan on unstaking soon. Ask on Telegram and you will get some well informed, yet weary answers (this makes up a good chunk of the debate on there). 

Q: What is the major FUD against this project?
A: Firstly, that ETH fees will decrease to the level where BSC becomes irrelevant. Devs have answered this by saying that if ETH fees are lowered to BSC levels, they will launch Bogtools for ETH as well. 

Secondly, the question of ""if this is doable, why haven't Pancakeswap implemented charts and limit orders themselves?"" Bogtools has first mover advantage here, and if Pancakeswap was able to do this, they would have done it already. Seeing as their code is not original (it's a fork of Uniswap), there is little likelihood of them implementing this in the near future. 

As of right now, the market cap is $16 million, which IMO is very small for what this project may deliver. This is not a clone or a fork, it's an original and innovative project and a real boon to the whole BSC. It should go far.

As of right now there is only a telegram page, this project has super low exposure, this is my candidate for a moon shot because the holders remains at 200 with supply pretty evenly distributed, I think if the devs push out what they intend to do in a timely manor the price could appreciate pretty easily, what made me like the project is the fact that I’m a front end dev and I’ve never seen a site look the way theirs does it’s pretty awesome, I have some respect for their front end engineer so without further ado I’ll leave some more info down below

“not counting tokens burnt”

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers! This project is super unique and the site showcases its potential as a low cap gem! ATH was around 30$ pretty good price entry right now hope to see you all at the bar! 🍹❤️

Fair Launched Token",moon,
t3_mex5fp,Bitclout - Decentralised social media. And a little present from me to reddit users,moon,
t3_mex5fp,"Hi everyone, I am a long time ghoster on reddit. However after encountering this sweet project here I thought I had to give back to the community and push it more.

Bitclout is being traded with btc. As they both present the same type of revolutionized value.

Bitcoin = a code being valued as money on a decentralised p2p platform

Bitclout = a social platform being value as money on a decentralised p2p platform

And if u think about it, the idea behind the revolution of btc holds in bitclout. It is simply better, more effective and beneficial for these platforms(finance, media) to go through the change into decentralised platforms.

So if u don't know bitclout is a social media based on a decentralised network, where u can purchase ""creator coins"" of every single profile for bitclout token (worth 150$ as of today) . And the profile itself is basically being traded (as if it was a stock or cryptocurrency). Please do notice, it is still in its infant stage, develompent is still ongoing. There are some big partners and investors on this one, and as of right now withdrawing on bitclout is not avaliable, but will be implemented. Those who look for actual moonshots should know they don't happen in a day, so prepare your butts for one hell of a ride. Also advice to read whitepaper.

t3_mf3pzv,$PIT - The reason im (Pit)bullish on this community token,moon,
t3_mf3pzv,"4 years ago we were in Altcoinheaven, everyday another low mcap coin flew straight to the moon.
This is year we might have Altcoin season again (if we are not in already) and memetokens are no doubt a big part of it. Wether you like it or not, they are pumping like crazy currently. There are tokens promising to bring you safe on the moon or the mars or animaltokens like hoge or chonk.
With all those Hundreds of memetokens many Investors got dumped on/rugpulled or had to sell at loss. Its all about Timing, research and trust. After i Made really good Profit with memecoins already, im conviced i found the next real moonshot in this ocean of memes. 

I present you $PIT (PitbullBSC): 

A Community driven BSC DeFi token with a growing holderbase (getting early HOGE-Vibes here).

50% Burned at the beginning / 2% burning of each transaction + 2% distrubution to every Holder.

Although at first Impression it seemed like another cheap knock-off with a crappy Website, my mind changed really fast after joining their Group. 

The original Dev Burned his LP and left the token for the Community to find it. A bunch of dedicated holders formed the new community around the coin. 

We encourage others to get active and join us in our journey. 

Anybody who wants to contribute is able to do so. 

And we always looking for new talented people all over the internet

In the last days, the community grew to over 4500 Holders, 2300 TG users, 120 subscriber on YouTube, 850 follower in twitter. You name it we got it. 

We paid for an professional audit https://twitter.com/TechRate1/status/1376094496203681795?s=09

We got approved to be listed on Whitebit and the community started to donate, which at the time of speaking is already over 5500$ from the 20k$ needed. 

An active members paid for a trust wallet listing and applied on their own behalf. 

We got listed on Blockfolio and are sitting on currently around 2.5M marketcap. 

With the new really awesome looking Website dropping in Monday + Coingecko, Coinmarketcap listing coming probably next week. 

The really good coin distribution (only 4 whales 🐳 holding about 1-2% rest is below 1%) makes the coin more safe from massive dump than the so called safecoins.

You can also look at our chart at https://poocoin.app/tokens/0xa57ac35ce91ee92caefaa8dc04140c8e232c2e50

And DYOR, our trading volume looks pretty nice and even big sells will recover fast. 

There are a lot of dedicated investors in our community and the got their stake in our coin!

t3_mfbmw4,"Only 100 holders, trusted developer, liquidity locked. Already has begun to pump up to the moon like the dev's last coins--Celebi and Triforce.  His philosophy is no rug, no dev dump, just let the game play out.  Tbh I think this dev is the ideal meme/shitcoin maker--just a fun little dalliance to try and make some money, no bullshit or scammery.  Previous projects by the same dev have gone multiple 100s of x within a day or two, probably because he is so trusted.  He even reminded people that it might be risky to buy before he locked the liquidity. There is a maximum transaction limit of exactly 1,111,111,111 to prevent large price swings and to even out the distribution of buyers. You can't really get earlier than this, folks.  I personally have done very well with his coins--as always, be ABSOLUTELY SURE to do your own research.  This ain't financial advice, et cetera et cetera.

The devs do seem to say they have plans for NFT's and merch. But it's still so early, all I know is they locked some liqidity and it doesn't seem at all like a rug. Just seems like a small hobby project. 

The people in here TG are all cool and pumping out memes so that's nice.

**Building the foundation**

Here, our main focuswill be marketing and listing. We will use the marketing tokens in order to fund efforts to grow the coin. We will also work towards being listed on CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap, as well as start the application process for a White-Bit listing.

**IDOPLATFORM**

Here, we will release a brand new IDO platform, much like DxSale, compatible with Ethereum Layer-2, Matic, Solana, and of course, BSC. This platform will have an immense feature list that includes liquidity locking and token generation

**Simplifying things**

Here we will start listing on as many exchanges as possible, with a focus on White-Bit, among others

t3_mfe0g8,"I found this coin earlier today and was pleasantly surprised to see that it has an actual website and active dev team in the Telegram.  Here is some information about the token itself:

&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope orbits 547 kilometres (340 miles) above Earth and travels 8 km (5 miles) every second. We're going there, safely.

&gt;Safe Hubble Telescope is a safe moon fork with high potential, while remaining a stable investment opportunity.

&gt;The team behind SAFEHT consists of professional developers with successful moon tokens already under their belt. Their promise for SAFEHT is as follows:

&gt;- A soft cap of 50 BNB and a hard cap of 250 BNB.

&gt;- 250,000,000 tokens available in pre-sale. Unsold tokens will be burnt.

&gt;- An 8% burn, including 4% going to holders and the remaining 4% to be burnt for good.

Here is all of their social media:

The devs are saying that a partnership announcement is coming up in about 10 hours. With only less than a 100 holders now, this could be a viable moonshot!

t3_mfbuhw,"Sup y'all!   
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves an easy way to get rid of wallet trackers, remain truly anonymous on the public blockchain and more.  
(now that the degens havent clicked on this post because of the title: this is actually a **100x** or more moonshot)

# So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. EBOX has the solution.   
Using the unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

That's a cool idea that will help many newcomers on crypto but as people get more familiar with crypto this problem fades away, and then a new problem arises. Anonymity.

**That is why I actually like this one.**

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:** 

&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

t3_mfan69,"Aleph.im (""ALEPH"") - Introductory write-up",ethereum,
t3_mfan69,"**What is Aleph.im?**

Aleph.im is a cross-chain network featuring decentralised cloud storage, cloud computing and a decentralised identity framework. Note that Aleph.im is not a blockchain but a decentralised network which has cross-chain compatibility with a number of smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos (full list can be found at: [https://aleph.im/#/chains](https://aleph.im/#/chains)). 

The developers of Aleph.im state that Aleph.im’s core mission is to help support dApps and protocols in achieving a fully decentralised architecture. This is done by providing decentralised databases with accompanying storage, computation and a decentralised identification framework.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

**What does Aleph.im have in plan for the future?**

Aleph.im has a sizeable agenda for 2021 and some of their notable targets for the year include:

* **GDPR compliance:** Implementing a right to be forgotten feature;
* **Channel sharding:** Sharding allows projects to create their own dedicated cloud clusters allowing channel’s to have accurate control over their scaling capacity. This will prevent performance from being affected by other projects running on Aleph.im; and
* **Wallet integrations:** Integration of wallets across the Polkadot, Cosmos &amp; Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

**Who are Aleph.im’s competitors?**

As a decentralised cloud storage provider, Aleph.im is discussed as competing with Filecoin. However, it should be noted that Filecoin is useful for those wanting to store large files, contrasting to Aleph.im who focuses on supercharging the DeFi ecosystem by allowing its dApps and protocols to migrate the centralised parts of their stack from cloud to decentralised computation and database services. Therefore, it could be explored that they are complementary as opposed to competing. Quoting the developers of Aleph.im: 

“A team could decide to build a dApp with the following stack:

* Smart contracts on Ethereum;
* Database, computing and DID on Aleph.im; and
* Large files such as videos and pdf’s on Filecoin.”

As a decentralised cloud computing provider, Aleph.im finds competition in the form of Akash Network. Akash Network is solely cloud computing and is restricted to the Cosmos ecosystem, where Aleph.im is also integrated into. Moreover, it is a Layer-2 solution which can be overlaid on the multitude of smart contract platforms it is integrated with.

Aleph.im’s comprehensive cloud network has a number of features that other platforms operate independently.

**Where can you buy ALEPH tokens?**

ALEPH tokens are available on a number of exchanges. The majority of the tokens volume goes through KuCoin (ALEPH/USDT), Uniswap (ALEPH/WETH) and MXC.COM (ALEPH/USDT).

As you may be aware, the KuCoin hack that occurred in September 2020 saw the majority of affected projects upgrade their tokens and roll-back these transactions to ensure that token-holders were not impacted. Like many other projects, Aleph.im did the same with their ALEPH token and with the support of the partner exchanges, v1 tokens were swapped out in place of v2 tokens. However, Hotbit did not forward the migrated ALEPH v2 tokens to its customers and continued to allow deposits and trading for the deprecated ALEPH v1 token. Therefore, if you are interested in ALEPH, please ensure that you do not purchase them from Hotbit.

**Conclusions**

Aleph.im appears to look to compete with a number of existing platforms but looks to offer a more comprehensive service where others focus on only one specific. Being easily compatible with a majority of the large smart contract platforms will be a strong addition compared to platforms that are restricted to their existing platform.

There are fair criticisms of the platform's current circulating supply but even at its fully diluted market cap there is significant scope for growth which is always beneficial from an investors point of view.

By way of disclosure, ALEPH comprises 0.5% of my portfolio and therefore I hope you can appreciate that I am pretty impartial to it as its growth will not materially impact me.

Differentiating itself from major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, DRC does not require mining or staking (proof of work and proof of stake are the two primary ways that transactions are processed) to process transactions specific to the coin itself, but instead relies on the already existing Ethereum network. 

Maxim Nurov, the coin's founder and longtime financial advisor and D.C. cryptocurrency advocate, has said that he not only developed the coin with simplicity and ease of adoption in mind, but that he also intends for it to be as accommodating to any future cryptocurrency SEC regulations.

t3_mf5fl4,"Zenon is implementing a fully decentralized dual-coin mechanism. The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.

What is it:

Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it:

This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.


Just looking at the chart and timeline is promising enough.  ZNN has an organic and strong growth rate and it's valuation is steady and we are still only in pre alpha.

# So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. EBOX has the solution.   
Using the unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

That's a cool idea that will help many newcomers on crypto but as people get more familiar with crypto this problem fades away, and then a new problem arises. Anonymity.

**That is why I actually like this one.**

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:** 

&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

t3_mex5fp,Bitclout - Decentralised social media. And a little present from me to reddit users,btc,
t3_mex5fp,"Hi everyone, I am a long time ghoster on reddit. However after encountering this sweet project here I thought I had to give back to the community and push it more.

Bitclout is being traded with btc. As they both present the same type of revolutionized value.

Bitcoin = a code being valued as money on a decentralised p2p platform

Bitclout = a social platform being value as money on a decentralised p2p platform

And if u think about it, the idea behind the revolution of btc holds in bitclout. It is simply better, more effective and beneficial for these platforms(finance, media) to go through the change into decentralised platforms.

So if u don't know bitclout is a social media based on a decentralised network, where u can purchase ""creator coins"" of every single profile for bitclout token (worth 150$ as of today) . And the profile itself is basically being traded (as if it was a stock or cryptocurrency). Please do notice, it is still in its infant stage, develompent is still ongoing. There are some big partners and investors on this one, and as of right now withdrawing on bitclout is not avaliable, but will be implemented. Those who look for actual moonshots should know they don't happen in a day, so prepare your butts for one hell of a ride. Also advice to read whitepaper.

Summary:

Radicle brings the possibility to store open source code in the blockchain. Currently most of the code of things we use everyday such as other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, among others are stored in centralised platforms such as GitHub. Which has had a history of blocking people from certain countries to be able to develop and collaborate in programming software.

This platform provides censorship resistant platform, available anywhere, and a free platform that uses the already familiarised open source Git. Providing an easy and familiar environment to code developers. They also allow for crowd funded project which is a very good future for many startups.

I hope you enjoyed this summary and I personally see potential on this platform moving forward. As always do your own research.

Everyone should always do research on their own before investing money. 

This is a deep analysis, so if you don't like to read much, this might not be for you.  
In my opinion 10x is one of the most innovative crypto projects with an actual use case and  
it probably won’t take long for them to establish themselves in a rapidly growing market.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Who’s the Team behind 10x.gg?

10x.gg is a sub-project of DMScript, a blockchain-gaming company dedicated to backing and releasing video game-related projects, utilizing the blockchain technology that has also proven to be unshakable in times of crisis.

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision. 

:) cheerz

t3_mf3ult,"I hope you all listened to me about $RED-P &amp; $YELLOW-P the other day. $0.72 to $4.65 and $9.84 to $65.40! Both projects less than 500k MC and both part of a new, innovative DeFi Yield Farm.",long,
t3_mf3ult,"I'm referring to [this post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mdvcah/redp_my_take_on_why_right_now_is_the_perfect/) the other day and [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/meejv9/redp_token_with_lots_of_potential_perfect_time_to/) made by another passionate member of our community, /u/Rotomboy. I'm not going to bore you with all the long details I wrote up in the original post, if you want to learn more and DYOR then check the links above.

The reason I'm posting again is to make you aware just **how crazy early it still is.** The team have announced another new feature is coming this evening (European time). I think I know what it is &amp; don't want to spoil it - but it will be yet another innovative gamification of your typical Yield Farms. This is exciting because I've not seen it done before &amp; it's just another method to continue contributing to the **scarcity of both tokens &amp; attract more farmers.**

As I referenced in the title, $RED-P is now climbing back up to it's ATH of $20. When I made my last post, it was $0.72 and hit $4.65 earlier. To make things even more exciting, if you had bought YELLOW-P when I made that post, you would have **watched it climb from $9.84... to $65.40 earlier today!** They've both dipped a bit since as people took profit (and you'd be crazy not to with those gains) - so this is probably right about a good time to ""buy the dip"" :)

**Quick TL;DR for those of you who decide not to click and read the more extensive threads I linked above:**

* Both tokens have a limited supply, with tokenomics to **burn more with every transaction** and add to the liquidity pool + distribute to farmers. There is *less than 100,000 RED-P and less than 10,000 YELLOW-P* and over time, these numbers will continue to decrease, driving more and more demand. This isn't like your typical Yield Farm that mint new tokens every block.
* There's a dynamic transaction limit to stop whales from dumping massive amounts of tokens and crashing the market
* The fee structure (which you can read more about in the thread above) is made in such a way that it incentivizes people to farm and hold, rather than pull out profits too often. Yet another good way to increase demand.
* There's a YELLOW-P jackpot with a 1/10 chance to win 10% of it and **1/100 chance to win ALL OF IT**. You roll this chance every time you make a transaction for YELLOW-P. Someone won nearly $500 a few hours ago. 
* The tokens are linked. You can't buy YELLOW-P without first buying RED-P to swap to it with. This is just another way of increasing demand.

So, why am I so excited? Apart from all the reasons listed here and in the previous threads - just look at the big picture. This isn't some meme-token with no use-case. If either of the tokens were to hit $1000 each, they would **still be less than $100m market cap**. *How crazy is that?* And to top it off, the combined $TVL of both tokens is still **less than $200k!** In a world where a meme-token like Hoge or Safemoon can hit $200m market-cap just through hype - where do you think a token that actually has a tiny supply will go? And the best part is, you can either hold or you can stake in the farm and watch your passive income trickle in.

Anyway, I will let you make your own decisions based on the merits here and in the previous threads. Please see below for all the details:

💊 **$RED-P - https://red.pill.finance**

* Total supply: 100,000
* Initial circulating supply: 25,000
* Ticker Symbol: RED-P
* Transaction fee: 1% (30% instant burn, 70% will flow back into the yield farm pool)
* [Max transaction size](https://i.imgur.com/llwSpFj.png)
* [Reward per block](https://i.imgur.com/Ykzkn3v.png)

💲 **How to buy**

* 1-2% slippage should be fine
* You can buy direct on the Red Pill site: https://exchange.pill.finance/#/swap 
* You can also buy on Pancakeswap if you wish: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x137fAAD0d13813ef8D4CBBB336F0E01066B2C9B4

💊 **$YELLOW-P - https://yellow.pill.finance**

* Total supply: 10,000
* Initial circulating supply: 1,000
* Ticker Symbol: YELLOW-P (Why didn't they choose YELP lol)
* Transaction fee: 9% (10% instant burn, 20% in jackpot, 70% will flow back into the yield farm pool)

One last thing to mention. In my last thread, I made a point to say there were a small number of holders. I've now realized we can't really look at this figure since any sensible person will be staking their tokens in the farm, thus would not show up as a holder on BSC scan. So don't be put off by those numbers, those are people who either have dust-amounts of tokens or simply don't know their true potential :)

As always DYOR &amp; this is not financial advice :)

EDIT: The new feature is a coinflip game that burns some of the tokens and transfers some to the jackpot!

t3_mexhaw,🚨WAKE. UP. NOW. 🚨🌱$RWN: A decentralised green energy blockchain with the potential to skyrocket! ($1m market cap) 🚀,long,
t3_mexhaw,"Finally a coin with an actual use case. I'm sick of these ""Safe"" coins that serve to pump once within the first 45 minutes and then dump with no chance of ever going back up again.

Wouldn't you rather start investing in coins with the same market caps but with an actual future? A coin that you can invest your money into and know that there's a team posting regular solutions to very real-world problems?

I present to you: 🌱 Rowan Energy ($RWN) 🌱

****

Price: ~$0.8

Supply: $45M

MC: ~$1M

****
Fully public team based in London (strict regulations and a long foundation, no potential for rug pulls or scams!) working non-stop since 2017.

Gaining momentum every day as more and more goals are being hit and investors are realizing that this project is about to take off in the coming months.

Team is very responsive and active in the community. 
No portion of the 45mil max supply was put aside for the team!, so no dumping or large dev sell-offs later on!

Fully functioning real world product.

New roadmap coming.

Impressive investors onboard (Simon Ludlam)

Tier 1 exchange/s coming soon! 

No marketing or overt shilling without any real development, all growth has come naturally and from successful implementations along the roadmap.

****

**What actually is it?**

Rowan energy is the world’s first community led green energy blockchain. Rowan enables domestic and commercial owners of rooftop solar to sell their generated energy to other consumers P2P‬, bringing in the best returns possible for solar and the cheapest green energy on the market. This is done so through the $RWN token, bypassing big energy suppliers and ensuring the customer retains more profit (&gt;70% more). Check out the rewards [here](https://youtu.be/iUltgVryaSI)

V1 going live this week along with marketing!!


****
**The Best Part:**

New homes in the UK will be required to produce 31 percent less carbon dioxide than they do now, which will require better energy efficiency. 

In the vast majority of cases, it is expected that solar will be the most cost-effective way for homebuilders to remain below the carbon threshold.

The new rules are expected to pass into law in the spring of 2021, and they will likely begin to be applied to new building plans starting in the spring of 2022. They are the precursor to a much stricter set of regulations, the Future Homes Standard, to be implemented in 2025 and which will cut permitted emissions by 80 percent.

****

**The Future of Rowan:**

In the near future, Rowan Energy will be partnering with a solar battery company to have their smart miners preinstalled in the batteries. 

This is a massive step in the right direction to facilitate mass adoption. Also, they will partner with another firm that specializes in obtaining energy utility licences. 

All the ground work has been finalised and both the firm and Rowan is now formalising their application following the the Beta testing with over 200 homes which concluded this February, and on the completion of the new rounds of fiat fundraising in March to April 2021.

****

**Can you connect the dots here...? I can and I smell profits. Big ones.**

Not surprisingly, Rowan has four private investment funds who want to come on board. One of which is a VC with very deep pockets that specializes in climate and renewable energy.

There is also no competition in the UK to speak of. 
‬
Closest comparison is $EWT and even that isn’t in the top 100 yet. 

$EWT Price: ~$16 

$EWT Supply: 100m (more than double $RWN’s!!)

$EWT MC: ~$500m 

Easy 500x just to reach EWT CAP 

1000x if it reaches top 90...

****

**The Team:**
CEO, David Duckworth, has significant experience as a network security specialist, engineer, analyst, blockchain and entrepreneur. 

Worked for employers and clients including Deutsche Bank and Aviva. 

The entire team is publicly listed along with their LinkedIn profiles and qualifications, giving genuine support and expertise to the company.
‪‬
People are only just starting to realise the true potential of this gem. Genuine project with a real use case. 1000x potential and beyond!

****

A really great in-depth read on the project and the tokenomics can be found here.  If you read this you will instantly become bullish. 

https://cryptoinparadise.medium.com/rowan-energy-the-bitcoin-crypto-underdog-holy-grail-of-the-energy-sector-1a116a95a2da

****

**Exchanges and Wallets:**

Currently only on 2 exchanges; Probit and LAtoken. 

I’ve used Probit multiple times now and it’s worked perfectly for me, no issues transferring $RWN to the official storage wallet either, found on the Rowan Energy Website.


Never been more bullish! Do your own research on this token and you will be even more confident, there is a serious potential for this token to skyrocket with an actual use case, and have large scale support as it develops.

t3_mf1vqf,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),long,
t3_mf1vqf,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).

*Here are 32 reasons why:*

***Tokenomics***

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.

***Platform***

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.

***Partners***

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.

***Community***

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/)with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

t3_mf0qpe,"First off, before blindly shilling this coin, I want to take a good look at what we're dealing with as I believe that there's plenty of merit to be skeptical.

OakTree Finance ($TREE) was announced on this subreddit about a month ago and there was a lot of speculation surrounding rug pulling in that thread. I've been following the progress and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I've been tracking wallet behaviors etc. and tried deep diving into the developers and their transaction history.

**Pros:**

* *Even though it ain't complete yet, they continue to work on their website, adding link functionality and additional content.*
* *Staking was released today as of March 28, 2021.*
* *Continues to add additional partners and verification.*
* *Delivered on every promise for now.*
* *Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to wallet behavior.*

**Cons:**

* *Bots, many bots... bots everywhere, especially twitter.*
* *Situated in Singapore and obscured knowledge about developers.*

**My Thoughts:**

* *If it was a rug pull, they're putting in a huge amount of effort into it and could've done so many times by now already.*
* *Bots could simply be a quick way to launch and get attention. A typical Asian way to gain attention, but in the western world it is frown upon somewhat.*

**Be careful if you choose to invest in this project, I've got some myself, but not more than I can afford to lose.**

**Feel free to debate and do your own research and post/comment your findings. With that out of the way, here's an introduction (Copy/Paste from site):**

# Oaktree Finance

OakTree Finance is a 3rd generation sustainable growth DEFI ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

&amp;#x200B;

**Oaktree.finance** has the potential become one of the largest liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and one of the fastest-growing AMMs and Asset pools in the DeFi market. We want to stand out from the rest of the DeFi sites by building a long term sustainable growth model.

**SUSTAINABLE GROWTH** Fees that are collected are reinvested to diversified external farms generate constant APY which will be used to buy up ACORN/TREE tokens every few days for the benefit of the community.

**ALPHA BURNING MECHANISM** Non native token farms will pay a 4-6% fee upon staking. The 4-6% will be used to purchase ACORN/TREE token and reinvested for its growth.

**UNIQUE LUCKY DRAW POOL** A lucky draw pool will be developed where a portion of participation token will be burn and the majority distributed as prizes.

**DIVERSIFIED VAULTS INDEX** A diversified vaults index will be create to cater to users who want to compound high APY yet diversify their risk. The mechanism allows users to spread their risk to various vaults and optimizers.

**NFT COLLECTION** OakTree.finance will generate its own collection of NFT (Non fungible token) and collaborate with other crypto artist to generate limited edition NFT. Once sold in future the proceeds will be used to reinvest and to burn ACORN/TREE token. We will also develop a comprehensive NFT world consisting of marketplace, arts, characters, land, property, pets etc.

**BSC LAUNCHPAD** We will provide the ability for projects to launch on our site similar to IFO and our presale function.

**FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS** Further developments such as advertisement and games revenue generation will be developed in future.

**SECURITY** Timelock added to contract at launch. Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap).

**Burn** 70% of the deposit fees will be used to purchase TREE and burnt  30% of the deposit fees will be sent to the developer’s address (This will be reinvested into diversified farms and APY use to buy and burn ACORN) Lucky draw (80% paid out as prizes and 20% burn) will be developed shortly. NFT sales in TREE or other token fees will be funneled back to reinvest and burnt Further developments in games will be constructed as we enter the later Epoch.

t3_mfcno1,"
I know your probably reading this and being tired off all these shit/meme coins being pumped 200-500% to then lose 80-90% overnight leaving you feeling with that loss of hope in these projects.

Too many projects are very similar in tokenomics and are all following the trend setter $HOGE$ in being deflationary and a burn % but with no long term plans or community engagement, we can all agree for a coin to perform well long term it requires consistent growth  in holders and a community that truly believe in a project, so in belief that they don’t have intentions of selling.

The problem is admins and devs think that a token will perform well because people just talk in a group chat on telegram and make memes all day long, it works well to pump a coin and sell the dream but then the real holders feel left out when there holdings drop to nothing, killing a project.

Take a look at recent meme/shit coins volume is dropped to nothing and buys and sells no longer occur every 20-40 seconds, more like every 20-40 mins. 

This is where a project like $PEECH$ comes in and hear me out, I will explain why $PEECH$ has a potential to be a great community with engagement on a weekly basis 😌😉 

Here’s the website, fairly nice design and niche for a project that’s less than 3 days old.

🔒All liquidity locked yep 100% of it🔒

25% Of Tokens distributed to the team fairly to help maintain the project long term.📈

🔒40% of the total supply divided into 2 wallets, one is locked for 6 months and one is locked for a week at a time. 🔒

Why is one locked for only one week?  Every week when one of the burn wallets unlock, $PEECH does a live stream and uses a randomizer to decide if we'll burn🔥 up to 5% of that wallet or if we'll send up to 5% of the wallet to one lucky $PEECH holder 🥳.  It's a new fun way to give back to the community!!!

There first giveaway is due 10th of April !🤪

Features like these will maintain the community long term, interaction with the community admins and devs gives every long term holder a sense of faith and security even during the hardest times 😇🙃

As Peach Finance grows, they will be donating to various food shelters across the world in a bid to give back to different communities not just ours ❤️💪🏽

t3_mfan69,"Aleph.im (""ALEPH"") - Introductory write-up",long,
t3_mfan69,"**What is Aleph.im?**

Aleph.im is a cross-chain network featuring decentralised cloud storage, cloud computing and a decentralised identity framework. Note that Aleph.im is not a blockchain but a decentralised network which has cross-chain compatibility with a number of smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos (full list can be found at: [https://aleph.im/#/chains](https://aleph.im/#/chains)). 

The developers of Aleph.im state that Aleph.im’s core mission is to help support dApps and protocols in achieving a fully decentralised architecture. This is done by providing decentralised databases with accompanying storage, computation and a decentralised identification framework.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

**What does Aleph.im have in plan for the future?**

Aleph.im has a sizeable agenda for 2021 and some of their notable targets for the year include:

* **GDPR compliance:** Implementing a right to be forgotten feature;
* **Channel sharding:** Sharding allows projects to create their own dedicated cloud clusters allowing channel’s to have accurate control over their scaling capacity. This will prevent performance from being affected by other projects running on Aleph.im; and
* **Wallet integrations:** Integration of wallets across the Polkadot, Cosmos &amp; Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

**Who are Aleph.im’s competitors?**

As a decentralised cloud storage provider, Aleph.im is discussed as competing with Filecoin. However, it should be noted that Filecoin is useful for those wanting to store large files, contrasting to Aleph.im who focuses on supercharging the DeFi ecosystem by allowing its dApps and protocols to migrate the centralised parts of their stack from cloud to decentralised computation and database services. Therefore, it could be explored that they are complementary as opposed to competing. Quoting the developers of Aleph.im: 

“A team could decide to build a dApp with the following stack:

* Smart contracts on Ethereum;
* Database, computing and DID on Aleph.im; and
* Large files such as videos and pdf’s on Filecoin.”

As a decentralised cloud computing provider, Aleph.im finds competition in the form of Akash Network. Akash Network is solely cloud computing and is restricted to the Cosmos ecosystem, where Aleph.im is also integrated into. Moreover, it is a Layer-2 solution which can be overlaid on the multitude of smart contract platforms it is integrated with.

Aleph.im’s comprehensive cloud network has a number of features that other platforms operate independently.

**Where can you buy ALEPH tokens?**

ALEPH tokens are available on a number of exchanges. The majority of the tokens volume goes through KuCoin (ALEPH/USDT), Uniswap (ALEPH/WETH) and MXC.COM (ALEPH/USDT).

As you may be aware, the KuCoin hack that occurred in September 2020 saw the majority of affected projects upgrade their tokens and roll-back these transactions to ensure that token-holders were not impacted. Like many other projects, Aleph.im did the same with their ALEPH token and with the support of the partner exchanges, v1 tokens were swapped out in place of v2 tokens. However, Hotbit did not forward the migrated ALEPH v2 tokens to its customers and continued to allow deposits and trading for the deprecated ALEPH v1 token. Therefore, if you are interested in ALEPH, please ensure that you do not purchase them from Hotbit.

**Conclusions**

Aleph.im appears to look to compete with a number of existing platforms but looks to offer a more comprehensive service where others focus on only one specific. Being easily compatible with a majority of the large smart contract platforms will be a strong addition compared to platforms that are restricted to their existing platform.

There are fair criticisms of the platform's current circulating supply but even at its fully diluted market cap there is significant scope for growth which is always beneficial from an investors point of view.

By way of disclosure, ALEPH comprises 0.5% of my portfolio and therefore I hope you can appreciate that I am pretty impartial to it as its growth will not materially impact me.

This project has amazing utility and will explode once the cyber security audience finds it. There has already been a security audit done, and tokens and liquidity are locked. Community is one of the most transparent I've seen, and is very active and professional. This is going to be a GEM.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have the time, here is the AMA that took place in the ""RedRoomTG"" telegram yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So Badchar. The project is pretty complicated yet simple. So lets bite into it in pieces.

What is Badchar, could you start explaining for non-coders where the name is from :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Of course, ""Badchar"" stands for bad character. Bad characters are inhibitors inside shellcodes that don't allow them to run smoothly. Usually, bad characters are found and taken out of scripts that are used in a buffer overflow attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What inspired the project to become what it is. I don't think there is something similar out there

&amp;#x200B;

A: Badchar is a cryptography-focused bsc project. The project challenges users by allowing them to compete in a capture the flag style game where they are rewarded with NFTs and a small amount of bep20 tokens dependent on the difficulty of said challenge. The project's inspiration came from a well-known cryptography challenge group known as ""Cicada 3301"". I was very intrigued by the challenges back in the day and thought that it could be implemented inside this space.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: For people who know Cicada, knows what they can expect from Badchar. But for those who don't know about this - Can you give an example of a ''Challenge'' - Without revealing to much that makes people go on a hunt :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:So, let's say that I have a .txt file and inside this txt file is something that looks like this: flag{this\_is\_a\_flag) . Once users find this document and there is a flag inside, users can then submit the flag to a submission area for points. In this case, it's for crypto rewards. The means to get to this flag vary in difficulty using many different types of cryptography and data obfuscation. Basically the flag is hiding and you need to find it using unorthodox practice :)

&amp;#x200B;

Q:You said the rewards can be in NFTs. Can you showcase one or two of them. (I Am a fan of the designs) but other might have a look to :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Certainly. [https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa](https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa) Here is a look at one of our less rare NFTs that will be used in the capture the flag challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Lets talk about rarity. So lets say one of the NFTs are super rare - How many pieces are we talking?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Right, so rarity is based upon the difficulty of the challenge. Each NFT in the challenge space is one of a kind, the circles at the bottom of the NFT indicate rarity. Think of it as a trading card system. 1 circle is common and 5 is ultra rare. This will indicate value for each NFT. This, however only goes for the challenge NFTs as market NFTs can be up to five of a kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Can people be rewarded in other things than Nfts? you mentioned tokens

&amp;#x200B;

badchar dev, \[28.03.21 18:59\]

A: Correct. The user will be rewarded with a small amount of tokens based on difficulty as well as receiving that challenges respective NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:When will the game begin? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:Great question :) We have a set of 3 challenges being released right after this AMA ends. These challenges are just for fun and will not be rewarding any tokens or NFTs yet. Think of it as a community driven test run to gauge response and how well users preform under the current difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Okay :) Btw. I understand the Audit from Dessert is done - Can you share for people in here to dive into it :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: We encourage everyone to look through this at their hearts content. Dessert Finance did a phenomenal job!

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Cool, so... Lets go to the second part of Badchar. VOID - What is it? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:The VOID is badchar's third party staking platform for long term holders to compound their gains. Details regarding the VOID will be releasing at a later time as it is currently in development :)

&amp;#x200B;

A (cont.):Badchar is in this for the long haul. As you know gorilla, I've been working on this for quite some time and over that time I've been able to work on quite a bit. We have much more NFT challenges coming, An entire RPG game that will incorporate the NFTs, Future partnerships in the works, and Future marketing in the works as well. just think of a video game version of the previous command line style NFT challenges. The RPG game will be able to use the NFTs as ability upgrades, NFT specific playable characters, and hints. This is why the NFTs will become vital to the future RPG game :)

t3_mex5fp,"Hi everyone, I am a long time ghoster on reddit. However after encountering this sweet project here I thought I had to give back to the community and push it more.

Bitclout is being traded with btc. As they both present the same type of revolutionized value.

Bitcoin = a code being valued as money on a decentralised p2p platform

Bitclout = a social platform being value as money on a decentralised p2p platform

And if u think about it, the idea behind the revolution of btc holds in bitclout. It is simply better, more effective and beneficial for these platforms(finance, media) to go through the change into decentralised platforms.

So if u don't know bitclout is a social media based on a decentralised network, where u can purchase ""creator coins"" of every single profile for bitclout token (worth 150$ as of today) . And the profile itself is basically being traded (as if it was a stock or cryptocurrency). Please do notice, it is still in its infant stage, develompent is still ongoing. There are some big partners and investors on this one, and as of right now withdrawing on bitclout is not avaliable, but will be implemented. Those who look for actual moonshots should know they don't happen in a day, so prepare your butts for one hell of a ride. Also advice to read whitepaper. [https://bitclout.com/one\_pager.pdf](https://bitclout.com/one_pager.pdf)

To those who already know whats up, hope you all enjoying the rollercoster grabbing as much as attention media creator coins avaliable on considarebly low market cap. (My gameplan anyway \~\_\~)

Reddit is one of the media sharks on the internet, and still so small (55k market cap) Hop in before this project gets the attention of all medias there are, and joined by mutual reddit's decentralized believers. Who may have found this project through reddit like me. [https://bitclout.com/u/reddit](https://bitclout.com/u/reddit)

If twitters board wasn’t a bunch of bootlickers he would have been removed a long time ago.  Many of very smart and prolific shareholders have been pretty outspoken about wanting him removed.

Might be time to take a shot on it...",long,
t1_gslnfrz,"Usually crypto moonshots are throwing pennies at upcoming coins and tokens and hoping that they pay off. Think of it as gambling with a twist right? What if there was no gambling involved?

to explain, there is no gambling on zenon. DD proves this is jacks baby. he conceived it, funded it and gave birth to it. square crypto and zenon are one in the same. if anyone has questions on this they can be easily answered.

long story short is that theres no way this can fail. for shits sake its nearly the same price as link, orion, and avax... and this thing is still in testing. 

SEC does not allow insider trading, if they saw znn as a security then SEC would go after Jack the way they did with ZUCC's funnymunny. notice how LIBRA is now DIEM... wonder why jack has no direct relation to zenon? if you do youre starting to understand.

SEC does not allow insider trading, BUT theres no fucking rule in crypto buddy, so now ask yourself, why a coin with no working product, amounting to *gasp* ^V^A^porware would be going for such a price when real chains like rose and hbar have working products... jacks makin his buddies fucking rich. 

literally its a IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW thing, meme aside, this is a fucking sure fire 100% bet. theres no stopping this. BLUESKYS ALL I SEE!",long,
t3_mf4q7x,$UNITiProtocol is doing more for holders by rewarding smaller wallets and being active in the community.,long,
t3_mf4q7x,"$UNITiProtocol is a token based off some recently popular coins with a new take on rewarding members beyond simple reflection tokenomics. Active dev and marketing leadership are reducing fast sells and investing in long term growth of a proven code by working with the community to generate involvement from the ground up.

The first order of business is to airdrop anyone using their hashtag on Twitter as long as they've shared their public address to receive it. Holders can accumulate 5 times a day and tokens are sent out each night. High quality tweets will get shared and receive bonus tokens as well.

There's a strong roadmap for the development of the network including NFTs and integration with other projects to be announced, as well as additional plans every week to keep sending more tokens to anyone active in the environment beyond what they already earn just from the tokenomics.

The basis of the token is built on ease of use. No staking, no farming, just unity and accumulation. As great as it is to have automated smart contracts, it completely eliminates the ability for people to get involved, which causes pumps and dumps. UNITi has no interest in being a standard, run of the mill shitcoin and everyone is working their asses off to prove it on social media, in their telegram and on their site.

It's a TINY microcap project (sitting at about $260k) with amazing potential just by continuing to engage with holders and keep excitement moving for the project. There's a huge future ahead built on transparency and safety. The first liquidity link was burnt and there's a transaction cap to stop the price from obliterating your investment. You can check out their contract on BSCscan to see the deploy wallet's transactions to holders. This token only launched a few DAYS ago and it's already hit $1 and is on the road to doing it again. Total supply is only 1,000,000 token decreasing RAPIDLY.

t3_mf07ud,Before you scroll down! - Hear me out on this hidden gem called $MEMES.,long,
t3_mf07ud,"**$MEMES token (ironically not just another memes token)**  is striving to create a fully decentralized platform that will allow meme creators to get compensated for their work.

Although there are many meme communities out there already, none are currently operating in a decentralized way on the blockchain.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain environment, $MEMES Token is hoping to establish a platform that will be revolutionary for content creators and users alike. This will allow creators and users to interact directly, as well providing direct compensation to creators and an ad free environment for users.

Creators will have a greater incentive to produce content, and users will have a greater incentive to use the platform by being in control of how a creator is financially supported through the memes token upvoting system.

At the end, the aim is to integrate all of the meme ecosystem into a unified blockchain protocol, which will make sharing and interacting with the platform as transparent and easy as possible.

With its own app &amp; marketplace launching in May, $MEMES token has lots of potential to become something very big!

**ROADMAP:**

*MARCH:*

\* Official pre-sale launch! (25/03)  (SOLD OUT IN 10 SECONDS!)

\* CMC / CG listing awaiting approval

\* Already has an active &amp; fun community on Discord!

*APRIL:*

\* Aiming for first exchange listings to start in April!

\* Partnerships

\* Platform MVP!

\* First NFTs will be released

\* Official Audits should be completed by this point.

*MAY:*

\* App Deployment

\* Official Marketplace Launch

\* On top of this there is always on going development, the dev is very active in the community &amp; keen to keep everyone updated.

**TOKENOMICS:**

Total Supply: 100T

Total Circulating Supply: 70T

Market Cap: 800K

\*\*-\*\* To ensure the viability of the project long term a small portion of each transaction goes into the longevity and stability of the project :

\* 2% will automatically go into the locked liquidity pool, as Memes/BNB pair to ensure stable pricing

\* 2% will be automatically redistributed to incentivize people to hold Memes Tokens.

Contrary to other tokens, there is no burn as $MEMES tokens strives to build a long-term ecosystem and want to avoid reduction in liquidity and artificial increase of the value.

\*\*-\*\* To ensure liquidity and security to the community, Liquidity has been locked with Dxsale. \*\*30%\*\* of token supply is locked until January as well with 10 releases along the way. Upon each release of the locked tokens, there will be a community vote to decide how the tokens will be distributed i.e. development and marketing budget, community promotions, going into the liquidity pool or returning it to the locked pool for later use.

With it being almost 3  days old and around 700 holders, you could be the pioneer of a coin with amazing potential. You'd be hard-pressed to find many coins with high potential this early.

t3_mf60sv,"Hi folks - found something which I feel obliged to share. Finally got a memecoin I can HODL without waking up 5 times a night to check the price, dev is based as hell and seems to be pretty damn smart. This token is amazing and is like 4 days old or so - not really seen much shilling of it yet so probably a great time to get in.

They've got a bunch of features I haven't seen any other coins implement, which essentially assure us that as well as not being rugpulled, whales can't dump on our asses and leave us bagholding. Anyone who holds over 0.1% of the max supply (virtually everyone so far I believe) is considered a whale - and they are restricted from selling more than 20% of their stack at a time. Once you've sold, you are unable to sell for another 24 hours. Didn't know this shit was even possible lol. Lots of things in the pipleline, e.g. NFT marketplace and our very own swap. I'm bullish on this token and think some of you may be pretty interested too.

If you own 0.1% of circulating tokens, you are considered a whale.

That means that you will only be able to sell 20% of your wallet per day.

If you hold less than 0.1% of all circulating tokens, then you are not a whale, and you can sell as you wish.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Who’s the Team behind 10x.gg?

# Tokenomics, Product and User Adoption, Driver of Value

&amp;#x200B;

* `Token Type: ERC20`
* `Overall Supply:` `1.000.000.000`
* `Current Circulating Supply:  200.000.000`
* `Current Market Cap: ~ 3.5 million`
* `Current Holders (Etherscan): 844`  


The project started without any token sale for $XGG. Currently the total liquidity on Uniswap is over 2.5 Million USDT, what’s quite noteworthy for a new project without any pre sale and such small market cap, whereby 50% of liquidity is locked via unicrypt.   [LINK](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0x123b5a3a816aeb1c901e58bc81937fcf159269fe) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*1st Driver of Value:*  
***The Onboarding of other ERC20 tokens on the platform***

10x offers an opportunity to other companies to join the platform with their native tokens.  
They will be able to apply for token listings and need to pay for the listing services with $XGG.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision.

t3_mf6fod,Giveback token,link,
t3_mf6fod,"Without any unnecessary advertising I just wanted to let you guys know that on Tuesday a new project start on PancakeSwap. It's called a Giveback token.

It works basically as SafeMoon, but with quite interesting feature, where transaction fees are: 1) redistributed to Charity Wallet, 2) burned and 3) being redistributed to all holders. Every month you can vote on charities to which coins will be passed to (coins, which are gathered in Charity Wallet). Voting mechanism is available on their website.

Comparing it to SafeMoon, this project is kind of similar in terms of tokenomics, but here you have an actual (and quite noble) use-case. It's pre-launch as mentioned (will start in 2 days), so marketing is just getting started. Dev team on Telegram is getting alive and you can talk directly with them to verify it's potential by yourself :)

PS. I was approached by one of project developers, because I was one of the first members of Giveback subreddit. Doesn't look scamy, but of course... Think for yourself. I can't vouch for anything and for me personally it looked promising. But, it's just for me. You have to evaluate it yourself :) No contract etc. is available for now, because token wasn't launched yet (so it's not strange). Everything is just on the way, so... Read and invest early if you like it or just let it slide if it won't convince you :) As always - project like this need traction in the begining.

t3_mf3o2b,"[📷Low MCAP coin](https://mozartfinance.io/) 
This project seems to actually have a team behind it, that cares about the community from what I've researched. Don't follow me blindly though and DYOR, but looks like an extreme moonshot.

What is [MozartFinance.io](https://mozartfinance.io/) ?
Mozart Finance is a fork from Goose Finance &amp; astonishing DeFi project running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

Liquidity LOCKED FOR 8 MONTHS
The fact that they audited code before lunch and removed migrator code is what makes this a one-of-a-kind project.

AUDITED BY [@ImmuneBytes](https://twitter.com/ImmuneBytes) - they have worked on various top crypto projects and have a great understanding of DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, Swissborg, Ox protocol, Uniswap etc.

There is common knowledge about migrator code in pancakeswap masterchef contract. With this option, it is highly possible to do a rug pull. Although they might not do it, the code is still present in their contract and this code is exactly how all the rug pulls were done.

Mozart finance has removed the following migrator code from their contract and audit also proves that contracts are safe. You can see the following code is still present in pancake swap’s contract and Github.

-HIGH APR FARM  !

Website: https://mozartfinance.io/

Telegram: https://t.me/MozartFinance

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MozartFinance

Their mission is to create a splendid perpetual deflation token that performs like a symphony. Native token PIANO will provide a stable price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. They are not trying to replace the swap &amp; exchange but rather to add value to the system and create a sustainable environment for people to yield farms with high APR.

PIANO token is live on:https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xd46936677b2c1bb696f2b67c55239331e2b7cd42

The team had a bit of a rocky start but they come on top by burning some tokens and taking one for the community
All in all, it's a deflationary token that's getting on the Music NFT bandwagon with an active team and seemingly community and a low marketcap - the kinda thing we've seen get mooned in the past, and after coingecko it will just run and run.

t3_mf1vqf,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),link,
t3_mf1vqf,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).

*Here are 32 reasons why:*

***Tokenomics***

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.

***Platform***

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.

***Partners***

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.

***Community***

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/)with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t3_mfaccy," 

**$XGG - 10x gg**

$XGG is the coin for the 10x gg platform. The platform will allow users to enter their respective coins into daily lottery pools with odds of 2/1 to 100/1. Basically allowing users to 100x their coins within 24 hours!

The platform makes a profit from 10% fees received from all pools (apart from the $XGG pool), which will be 100% used for buyback programs and the purchasing of XGG from the open market, causing significant buy pressure considering pools are constantly ongoing every day.

**Team -**

Non-anon team with tons of crypto experience! The coin is built by the **DM Script team** (here's a link to their Twitter: [https://twitter.com/DMScript](https://twitter.com/DMScript))

**Roadmap**

Here's a link to the roadmap: [https://twitter.com/10xdotgg/status/1369788337066713089](https://twitter.com/10xdotgg/status/1369788337066713089)

\- Platform launch coming by end of March (beta already released [http://test.10x.gg/](http://test.10x.gg/) ). Therefore, it may be a good idea to front run the hype before the launch.

\- $250k marketing budget for platform launch including crypto influencer promotions (they work!)

\- Staking coming by end of March with 300% APY.

\- Token listing platform/ICO launchpad (think of the amount of hype new coins could generate if they entered into the pools on launch)

\- Binance smart chain integration

\- Adding other games to the platform to become **the** **main one stop shop for crypto gambling, a HUGE market!**

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Monthly Buybacks

 \- Fair Launch (No Token Sale)

 \- 2.8M Liquidity and marketcap is only 2.5m

 \- Legit Team 

\- $250k Marketing Campaign

 \- ICO Launchpad Q2 

\- 300% APY Staking

t3_mf2l3w,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Backed By Binance Cloud,link,
t3_mf2l3w,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

t3_mf0qpe,OakTree Finance ($TREE) Sustainable Defi app on Binance Smart Chain,link,
t3_mf0qpe,"First off, before blindly shilling this coin, I want to take a good look at what we're dealing with as I believe that there's plenty of merit to be skeptical.

OakTree Finance ($TREE) was announced on this subreddit about a month ago and there was a lot of speculation surrounding rug pulling in that thread. I've been following the progress and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I've been tracking wallet behaviors etc. and tried deep diving into the developers and their transaction history.

**Pros:**

* *Even though it ain't complete yet, they continue to work on their website, adding link functionality and additional content.*
* *Staking was released today as of March 28, 2021.*
* *Continues to add additional partners and verification.*
* *Delivered on every promise for now.*
* *Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to wallet behavior.*

**Cons:**

* *Bots, many bots... bots everywhere, especially twitter.*
* *Situated in Singapore and obscured knowledge about developers.*

**My Thoughts:**

* *If it was a rug pull, they're putting in a huge amount of effort into it and could've done so many times by now already.*
* *Bots could simply be a quick way to launch and get attention. A typical Asian way to gain attention, but in the western world it is frown upon somewhat.*

**Be careful if you choose to invest in this project, I've got some myself, but not more than I can afford to lose.**

# Oaktree Finance

OakTree Finance is a 3rd generation sustainable growth DEFI ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

&amp;#x200B;

**Oaktree.finance** has the potential become one of the largest liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and one of the fastest-growing AMMs and Asset pools in the DeFi market. We want to stand out from the rest of the DeFi sites by building a long term sustainable growth model.

**SUSTAINABLE GROWTH** Fees that are collected are reinvested to diversified external farms generate constant APY which will be used to buy up ACORN/TREE tokens every few days for the benefit of the community.

**ALPHA BURNING MECHANISM** Non native token farms will pay a 4-6% fee upon staking. The 4-6% will be used to purchase ACORN/TREE token and reinvested for its growth.

**UNIQUE LUCKY DRAW POOL** A lucky draw pool will be developed where a portion of participation token will be burn and the majority distributed as prizes.

**DIVERSIFIED VAULTS INDEX** A diversified vaults index will be create to cater to users who want to compound high APY yet diversify their risk. The mechanism allows users to spread their risk to various vaults and optimizers.

**NFT COLLECTION** OakTree.finance will generate its own collection of NFT (Non fungible token) and collaborate with other crypto artist to generate limited edition NFT. Once sold in future the proceeds will be used to reinvest and to burn ACORN/TREE token. We will also develop a comprehensive NFT world consisting of marketplace, arts, characters, land, property, pets etc.

**BSC LAUNCHPAD** We will provide the ability for projects to launch on our site similar to IFO and our presale function.

**FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS** Further developments such as advertisement and games revenue generation will be developed in future.

**SECURITY** Timelock added to contract at launch. Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap).

**Burn** 70% of the deposit fees will be used to purchase TREE and burnt  30% of the deposit fees will be sent to the developer’s address (This will be reinvested into diversified farms and APY use to buy and burn ACORN) Lucky draw (80% paid out as prizes and 20% burn) will be developed shortly. NFT sales in TREE or other token fees will be funneled back to reinvest and burnt Further developments in games will be constructed as we enter the later Epoch.

**Last but not least, I would love to get your feedback on this post. Would you rather leave these on edge projects alone (And out of the CryptoMoonShots reddit in general) or is it fine with some skeptical information and speculation?**",link,

I know your probably reading this and being tired off all these shit/meme coins being pumped 200-500% to then lose 80-90% overnight leaving you feeling with that loss of hope in these projects.

Too many projects are very similar in tokenomics and are all following the trend setter $HOGE$ in being deflationary and a burn % but with no long term plans or community engagement, we can all agree for a coin to perform well long term it requires consistent growth  in holders and a community that truly believe in a project, so in belief that they don’t have intentions of selling.

The problem is admins and devs think that a token will perform well because people just talk in a group chat on telegram and make memes all day long, it works well to pump a coin and sell the dream but then the real holders feel left out when there holdings drop to nothing, killing a project.

Take a look at recent meme/shit coins volume is dropped to nothing and buys and sells no longer occur every 20-40 seconds, more like every 20-40 mins. 

This is where a project like $PEECH$ comes in and hear me out, I will explain why $PEECH$ has a potential to be a great community with engagement on a weekly basis 😌😉 

Here’s the website, fairly nice design and niche for a project that’s less than 3 days old. 

🍑https://www.peachfinance.org🍑

🔒All liquidity locked yep 100% of it🔒

https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/
0x08eEed38253AF4c0a86fba4fB48051C823827454

25% Of Tokens distributed to the team fairly to help maintain the project long term.📈

🔒40% of the total supply divided into 2 wallets, one is locked for 6 months and one is locked for a week at a time. 🔒

Why is one locked for only one week?  Every week when one of the burn wallets unlock, $PEECH does a live stream and uses a randomizer to decide if we'll burn🔥 up to 5% of that wallet or if we'll send up to 5% of the wallet to one lucky $PEECH holder 🥳.  It's a new fun way to give back to the community!!!

There first giveaway is due 10th of April !🤪

Features like these will maintain the community long term, interaction with the community admins and devs gives every long term holder a sense of faith and security even during the hardest times 😇🙃

As Peach Finance grows, they will be donating to various food shelters across the world in a bid to give back to different communities not just ours ❤️💪🏽

t3_mf8cz6,$PEECH - live stream of a randomiser being used to decide burn and giveaway from developer wallet. Liquidity locked for 12 MONTHS!!,link,
t3_mf8cz6,"$PEECH was released yesterday and is only currently available on uniswap. Liquidity is locked for 12 months and the link is below to check it on the web.

$PEECH is a fresh innovative new crypto that interacts with its holders via live stream video burning and giveaway show. Every week the owner, who is doxxed and not hiding his identity, will host a show where he will use a randomiser to choose between 0.01-5%. What ever percentage is chosen he will then burn or giveaway, depending on what category he is doing.

No transaction tax, no need raise slippage. All the burn and redistribution is done through lottery system. So one lucky winner gets a huge sum of $PEECH (could be over $2000) 

I like this because it is original and the guy is honest. I met him online and he has always come through and is a stand up guy. The 12 months locked liquidity is a show of this. He has thrown everything in to this and I trust he will make it a success. 

Price is stabilising at the moment but is still plenty of time to get on before the first live stream and have a chance to win 4 billion $PEECH

t3_mfcslx,"Welcome Shit Coin brought to you by the legend himself, Shitoshi

Symbol: SHIT

Supply: 1 trillion

Features: completely anonymous team, no whitepaper, nothing novel just an ERC-20 token, and unclear and unrealistic roadmap

Motto:  To advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter. 

No innovation. No point. No problem!

Why Shit Coin:  To provide whales, traders, and early adopters a pure shitconin experience. Whales will be given preferential treatement such as early private discounted sales, insider information from dev team etc. To envcourage merchants to adopt ShitCoin as a standard for digital payments. We will ask them nicely with a very well written letter.

t1_gslnfrz,"Usually crypto moonshots are throwing pennies at upcoming coins and tokens and hoping that they pay off. Think of it as gambling with a twist right? What if there was no gambling involved?

to explain, there is no gambling on zenon. DD proves this is jacks baby. he conceived it, funded it and gave birth to it. square crypto and zenon are one in the same. if anyone has questions on this they can be easily answered.

long story short is that theres no way this can fail. for shits sake its nearly the same price as link, orion, and avax... and this thing is still in testing. 

SEC does not allow insider trading, if they saw znn as a security then SEC would go after Jack the way they did with ZUCC's funnymunny. notice how LIBRA is now DIEM... wonder why jack has no direct relation to zenon? if you do youre starting to understand.

SEC does not allow insider trading, BUT theres no fucking rule in crypto buddy, so now ask yourself, why a coin with no working product, amounting to *gasp* ^V^A^porware would be going for such a price when real chains like rose and hbar have working products... jacks makin his buddies fucking rich.

t3_mfcb4k,"If you missed the recent growth of $Hoge/$SafeMoon, then check out DOGEY!

I just found this new memecoin ($DOGEY) with HUGE potential, it could easily 100x in price! Personally just aped in 🚀🚀🚀

Why I think this is a solid coin 👇

1. Stealth-launched Uniswap coin with a marketcap literally in the thousands, as of now.
2. NFT coin, and NFTs created by emerging/well-known artists for Dogey will have profits donated to charity
3. Professional looking website with all links working &amp; great design
4. Token buyback/burn most likely coming in early April according to the team in Telegram
5. Simple tokenomics - 10 billion supply (fixed), 1% reserved for treasury

The team has also stated that they're in talks with animal shelters in the United States, and will soon reach an agreement around mid-Q2 for the release of NFTs to directly support the shelter and its animals. 

Looks like this could be a huge opportunity. Make sure to check it out!

**IDOPLATFORM**

Here, we will release a brand new IDO platform, much like DxSale, compatible with Ethereum Layer-2, Matic, Solana, and of course, BSC. This platform will have an immense feature list that includes liquidity locking and token generation

**Simplifying things**

Here we will start listing on as many exchanges as possible, with a focus on White-Bit, among others

t3_mf4q7x,$UNITiProtocol is doing more for holders by rewarding smaller wallets and being active in the community.,link,
t3_mf4q7x,"$UNITiProtocol is a token based off some recently popular coins with a new take on rewarding members beyond simple reflection tokenomics. Active dev and marketing leadership are reducing fast sells and investing in long term growth of a proven code by working with the community to generate involvement from the ground up.

The first order of business is to airdrop anyone using their hashtag on Twitter as long as they've shared their public address to receive it. Holders can accumulate 5 times a day and tokens are sent out each night. High quality tweets will get shared and receive bonus tokens as well.

There's a strong roadmap for the development of the network including NFTs and integration with other projects to be announced, as well as additional plans every week to keep sending more tokens to anyone active in the environment beyond what they already earn just from the tokenomics.

The basis of the token is built on ease of use. No staking, no farming, just unity and accumulation. As great as it is to have automated smart contracts, it completely eliminates the ability for people to get involved, which causes pumps and dumps. UNITi has no interest in being a standard, run of the mill shitcoin and everyone is working their asses off to prove it on social media, in their telegram and on their site.

It's a TINY microcap project (sitting at about $260k) with amazing potential just by continuing to engage with holders and keep excitement moving for the project. There's a huge future ahead built on transparency and safety. The first liquidity link was burnt and there's a transaction cap to stop the price from obliterating your investment. You can check out their contract on BSCscan to see the deploy wallet's transactions to holders. This token only launched a few DAYS ago and it's already hit $1 and is on the road to doing it again. Total supply is only 1,000,000 token decreasing RAPIDLY.

t3_mf60sv,"Hi folks - found something which I feel obliged to share. Finally got a memecoin I can HODL without waking up 5 times a night to check the price, dev is based as hell and seems to be pretty damn smart. This token is amazing and is like 4 days old or so - not really seen much shilling of it yet so probably a great time to get in.

They've got a bunch of features I haven't seen any other coins implement, which essentially assure us that as well as not being rugpulled, whales can't dump on our asses and leave us bagholding. Anyone who holds over 0.1% of the max supply (virtually everyone so far I believe) is considered a whale - and they are restricted from selling more than 20% of their stack at a time. Once you've sold, you are unable to sell for another 24 hours. Didn't know this shit was even possible lol. Lots of things in the pipleline, e.g. NFT marketplace and our very own swap. I'm bullish on this token and think some of you may be pretty interested too.

That means that you will only be able to sell 20% of your wallet per day.

&amp;#x200B;

If you hold less than 0.1% of all circulating tokens, then you are not a whale, and you can sell as you wish.

$SafeX is a community driven project made for all the SpaceX lovers.  SafeX employs 3 great functions : Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn In each trade, each transaction is taxed and fee is redistributed to all existing holders.  


The team is extremely dedidacted and has been delivering nothing but bullish news.   
They have already minted some NFTs that will be distributed before the launch today and there are more airdrops scheduled on the roadmap.  
All their tokens have already been burned (that's actually rare with any SAFE fork) which makes it 100% fair, and maximum contribution is 2 BNB, so it is also whale-proof.

t3_mfb4ph,The Reason why $XGG have 100x Potential,usdt,
t3_mfb4ph,"Before I start, let me point out that this post is no financial advice.  
Everyone should always do research on their own before investing money. 

This is a deep analysis, so if you don't like to read much, this might not be for you.  
In my opinion 10x is one of the most innovative crypto projects with an actual use case and  
it probably won’t take long for them to establish themselves in a rapidly growing market.

# What is 10x.gg ?

10x is a new and unique lottery based gaming platform that has been created for crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently already available in test mode ( [http://test.10x.gg](http://test.10x.gg/) ) the platform will go live on Tuesday, March 30th 2021

The UI design looks sleek and has a great usability.The concept is quite simple but clever. Users will be able to participate in pool rounds by putting a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in that pool. The pools are not limited to $XGG only, but rather designed to be usable with any ERC20 token in the future.

Every pool has a lifespan of 24 hours and has to be filled by a certain number of participants.

There will be multiple different pools available on the platform which will vary in the number of participants, the currency and accordingly the profit of the players.

All the pools will have to be divisible by 10. For example, a 10 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 1 ETH, a 20 ETH pool can be joined by 10 people investing 2ETH and a 100ETH pool can be joined by 10 people each investing 10 ETH. The combinations can be endless.

To put it more simply, the winners of each pool will end up with 10 times what they initially put in that pool.

# Who’s the Team behind 10x.gg?

10x.gg is a sub-project of DMScript, a blockchain-gaming company dedicated to backing and releasing video game-related projects, utilizing the blockchain technology that has also proven to be unshakable in times of crisis. If you’ve never heard of DMScript, make sure to check them out on their medium [HERE](https://dmscript.medium.com/) or website [HERE](http://dmscript.com/) They've forged some nice partnerships in the past. OG eSports, Nvidia, Sambrela Studios, Modefi - to name a few.

The team of 10X consists of experienced developers and designers and have extensive know-how in the space. Make sure to look them up on LinkedIn and check out their skills and endorsements section.

# Tokenomics, Product and User Adoption, Driver of Value

&amp;#x200B;

* `Token Type: ERC20`
* `Overall Supply:` `1.000.000.000`
* `Current Circulating Supply:  200.000.000`
* `Current Market Cap: ~ 3.5 million`
* `Current Holders (Etherscan): 844`  


The project started without any token sale for $XGG. Currently the total liquidity on Uniswap is over 2.5 Million USDT, what’s quite noteworthy for a new project without any pre sale and such small market cap, whereby 50% of liquidity is locked via unicrypt.   [LINK](https://unicrypt.network/amm/uni/pair/0x123b5a3a816aeb1c901e58bc81937fcf159269fe) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*1st Driver of Value:*  
***The Onboarding of other ERC20 tokens on the platform***

10x offers an opportunity to other companies to join the platform with their native tokens.  
They will be able to apply for token listings and need to pay for the listing services with $XGG.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2nd Driver of Value:  
***Staking of XGG Tokens on the Platform***

XGG will support staking, allowing you to lock up your bags of $XGG for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, which will help you receive a share that could rise up to 300% of your staked coin. The staking program will take place on the platform itself, this will enable everyone, even those without much knowledge in the crypto industry to take part in the staking economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3rd Driver of Value:  
***The $XGG Buyback Program***

In every pool draw the winners will get 90 percent of the money while the 10% will be the platform’s profit. All the profit generated by the platform will be dedicated towards buybacks. For example if the total volume in the platform is $100 million, the platform will make 10 percent of this; in our case, $10 million will be the profit and it will all be used in buyback programs for the $XGG Token.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4th Driver of Value  
***A Comprehensive Marketing Campaign*** 

10x.gg will be positioned in a very unique manner, as a platform that brings real value to the users. The marketing campaign will be intensive and a total of $250,000 dollars will be spent on various marketing operations. They will run loads of ads whereby the focus will be on main leading websites and platforms dedicated to finance and cryptocurrency and also campaigns on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5th Driver of Value  
**The Joy of Winning**

People like to win, this isn't a new concept. Playing games has a positive impact on the lives of players, allowing them to escape from stress, problems at work, depression, life worries or negative emotions. It satisfies the need for excitement and relaxation for players.People like to share their achievements with their friends and peers all over social media. This will lead to an increase of the name recognition of 10x, the number of users and so results in an increase in value of the $XGG token.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Rapidly Growing Market

World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and 4.2 billion gamble at least once every year.

A new corporate report by the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator has revealed that compared to the values achieved in 2019, the amount of cryptocurrency gambling traffic has increased threefold in 2020. A number of top providers have all reported significant increases in the amount of funds generated by cryptocurrencies over the past year.

The main benefits to using cryptocurrencies for gambling are obvious.

Transactions occur rapidly (near-instant), including immediate and automatic withdrawal and/or deposits. Transactions are non-reversible (no charge-backs).Players can retain their anonymity. Cryptocurrencies can be used to gamble by anyone with an internet connection, and there is no need to have access to traditional banking services

In addition, gambles that use blockchain are open to verification, so gamblers can ensure games are fair. Due to the blockchain technology, there is no way for gambling operators to cheat, or interfere with outcome or payments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, enough for now. Let that all sink in, sleep on it for one night and make your own decision. 

:) cheerz

Comparing it to SafeMoon, this project is kind of similar in terms of tokenomics, but here you have an actual (and quite noble) use-case. It's pre-launch as mentioned (will start in 2 days), so marketing is just getting started. Dev team on Telegram is getting alive and you can talk directly with them to verify it's potential by yourself :)

PS. I was approached by one of project developers, because I was one of the first members of Giveback subreddit. Doesn't look scamy, but of course... Think for yourself. I can't vouch for anything and for me personally it looked promising. But, it's just for me. You have to evaluate it yourself :) No contract etc. is available for now, because token wasn't launched yet (so it's not strange). Everything is just on the way, so... Read and invest early if you like it or just let it slide if it won't convince you :) As always - project like this need traction in the begining.

This project seems to actually have a team behind it, that cares about the community from what I've researched. Don't follow me blindly though and DYOR, but looks like an extreme moonshot.

What is [MozartFinance.io](https://mozartfinance.io/) ?
Mozart Finance is a fork from Goose Finance &amp; astonishing DeFi project running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

Liquidity LOCKED FOR 8 MONTHS
The fact that they audited code before lunch and removed migrator code is what makes this a one-of-a-kind project.

AUDITED BY [@ImmuneBytes](https://twitter.com/ImmuneBytes) - they have worked on various top crypto projects and have a great understanding of DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, Swissborg, Ox protocol, Uniswap etc.

There is common knowledge about migrator code in pancakeswap masterchef contract. With this option, it is highly possible to do a rug pull. Although they might not do it, the code is still present in their contract and this code is exactly how all the rug pulls were done.

Mozart finance has removed the following migrator code from their contract and audit also proves that contracts are safe. You can see the following code is still present in pancake swap’s contract and Github.

-HIGH APR FARM  !

Website: https://mozartfinance.io/

Telegram: https://t.me/MozartFinance

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MozartFinance

Their mission is to create a splendid perpetual deflation token that performs like a symphony. Native token PIANO will provide a stable price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. They are not trying to replace the swap &amp; exchange but rather to add value to the system and create a sustainable environment for people to yield farms with high APR.

PIANO token is live on:https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xd46936677b2c1bb696f2b67c55239331e2b7cd42

The team had a bit of a rocky start but they come on top by burning some tokens and taking one for the community
All in all, it's a deflationary token that's getting on the Music NFT bandwagon with an active team and seemingly community and a low marketcap - the kinda thing we've seen get mooned in the past, and after coingecko it will just run and run.

Get it while the price is cheap! We are shooting to the moon, boys and already at 100+ holders!!",etc,
t3_mfdzsq,$Elo still pumping strong - use cases on the roadmap and TikTok Marketing campaign in full force,etc,
t3_mfdzsq,"I’ll cut straight to the point: 99% of these meme coins are either rugs, or they fizzle out and die after 2 hours. However, I have found one that actually has some qualities that make it a much safer option than most of these coins. 

1. The owner is Ken the Crypto, a YouTuber. He has put much of his own funds into the coin like everyone else and is working nonstop to promote it and market it intelligently. The fact he’s putting his name on this and doxxing himself is a great assurance that he won’t rug and completely destroy his career and reputation. 

2. TikTok influencer marketing is incoming. We have raised money as a community with some of our initial profits to fund some tiktok influencer marketing (two accounts today with a total of \~4M followers). We are told that the first big influencer video will be dropping within the hour and I have a strong feeling that’ll correlate to a strong influx of new holders

3. Engaged community. Yes I know everyone says this about coins but this seems different. Ken has his built in core audience who already know and trust him, so they’re more willing to go out and shill, and also feel comfortable buying in more and holding. I can’t emphasize enough how different this community feels from the countless that have anon devs who barely communicate with the tg. Ken is actually in there and also live streaming for hours a day to keep us engaged and let us know what he’s working on to promote this.

4. Volume is high. It just launched yesterday and as I type this we are pushing back past our previous ATH from yesterday. Usually if a shitcoin is going to fizzle out it happens relatively quickly. This one is just gaining momentum which makes me think we’re going to see it blow up similarly to a safemars or safemoon level in the coming days. As I’ve previously stated, all of these factors combined with the trust of a doxxed owner can make this soar. 

As always and especially with these shitcoins, DYOR! Be careful and don’t invest more than you can lose. Take small profits as you go as well so you don’t get left holding a bag.

t3_mf0qpe,OakTree Finance ($TREE) Sustainable Defi app on Binance Smart Chain,etc,
t3_mf0qpe,"First off, before blindly shilling this coin, I want to take a good look at what we're dealing with as I believe that there's plenty of merit to be skeptical.

OakTree Finance ($TREE) was announced on this subreddit about a month ago and there was a lot of speculation surrounding rug pulling in that thread. I've been following the progress and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I've been tracking wallet behaviors etc. and tried deep diving into the developers and their transaction history.

**Pros:**

* *Even though it ain't complete yet, they continue to work on their website, adding link functionality and additional content.*
* *Staking was released today as of March 28, 2021.*
* *Continues to add additional partners and verification.*
* *Delivered on every promise for now.*
* *Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to wallet behavior.*

**Cons:**

* *Bots, many bots... bots everywhere, especially twitter.*
* *Situated in Singapore and obscured knowledge about developers.*

**My Thoughts:**

* *If it was a rug pull, they're putting in a huge amount of effort into it and could've done so many times by now already.*
* *Bots could simply be a quick way to launch and get attention. A typical Asian way to gain attention, but in the western world it is frown upon somewhat.*

**Be careful if you choose to invest in this project, I've got some myself, but not more than I can afford to lose.**

**Feel free to debate and do your own research and post/comment your findings. With that out of the way, here's an introduction (Copy/Paste from site):**

# Oaktree Finance

OakTree Finance is a 3rd generation sustainable growth DEFI ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

&amp;#x200B;

**Oaktree.finance** has the potential become one of the largest liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and one of the fastest-growing AMMs and Asset pools in the DeFi market. We want to stand out from the rest of the DeFi sites by building a long term sustainable growth model.

**SUSTAINABLE GROWTH** Fees that are collected are reinvested to diversified external farms generate constant APY which will be used to buy up ACORN/TREE tokens every few days for the benefit of the community.

**ALPHA BURNING MECHANISM** Non native token farms will pay a 4-6% fee upon staking. The 4-6% will be used to purchase ACORN/TREE token and reinvested for its growth.

**UNIQUE LUCKY DRAW POOL** A lucky draw pool will be developed where a portion of participation token will be burn and the majority distributed as prizes.

**DIVERSIFIED VAULTS INDEX** A diversified vaults index will be create to cater to users who want to compound high APY yet diversify their risk. The mechanism allows users to spread their risk to various vaults and optimizers.

**NFT COLLECTION** OakTree.finance will generate its own collection of NFT (Non fungible token) and collaborate with other crypto artist to generate limited edition NFT. Once sold in future the proceeds will be used to reinvest and to burn ACORN/TREE token. We will also develop a comprehensive NFT world consisting of marketplace, arts, characters, land, property, pets etc.

**BSC LAUNCHPAD** We will provide the ability for projects to launch on our site similar to IFO and our presale function.

**FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS** Further developments such as advertisement and games revenue generation will be developed in future.

**SECURITY** Timelock added to contract at launch. Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap).

**Burn** 70% of the deposit fees will be used to purchase TREE and burnt  30% of the deposit fees will be sent to the developer’s address (This will be reinvested into diversified farms and APY use to buy and burn ACORN) Lucky draw (80% paid out as prizes and 20% burn) will be developed shortly. NFT sales in TREE or other token fees will be funneled back to reinvest and burnt Further developments in games will be constructed as we enter the later Epoch.

t3_mfcslx,"Welcome Shit Coin brought to you by the legend himself, Shitoshi

Symbol: SHIT

Supply: 1 trillion

Features: completely anonymous team, no whitepaper, nothing novel just an ERC-20 token, and unclear and unrealistic roadmap

Motto:  To advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter. 

No innovation. No point. No problem!

Why Shit Coin:  To provide whales, traders, and early adopters a pure shitconin experience. Whales will be given preferential treatement such as early private discounted sales, insider information from dev team etc. To envcourage merchants to adopt ShitCoin as a standard for digital payments. We will ask them nicely with a very well written letter.

t3_mf9244,"UpBots - UBXT - Trading bots are coming, whether you like them or not. May as well go with the best.",etc,
t3_mf9244,"**What is UpBots (UBXT)?**

UpBots is a trading platform (crypto initially but traditional markets coming later this year) that caters to literally everyone. 

Manual traders get all the features they'd usually look for - alert, risk management, iceberg, trailing etc with a beautifully designed UX/UI.

  
Those new to trading can take advantage of two types of bots. Firstly, the UpBots - specially designed AI bots that have already proven to have an incredible return rate. These can be rented using the UpBots native token, UBXT.

Users can also pick a bot from the 'supermarket' of user created bots. Traders can submit their own trading algorithms and if they are approved the are given their own bot. Here's the genius part: **Users can rent your bot and you'll receive 15% of any profit a user makes when using your bot.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Think about how many YouTube/Twitter traders there are in the*** [***cryptosphere.***](https://cryptosphere.Now) ***Now imagine they create their own bot and promote it to their viewers/followers.*** 

***Exactly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the company like?**

Really, really good. Like most of you, I join a lot of Telegrams and like to lurk around them before investing to try and get the cut of the developer's jib. These guys are top class. All the directors/CEOs actively participate in the Telegram chat and will happily take time out of the day to DM you about specific questions, concerns you may have. Not only that but they drop updates and roadmap additions constantly. They're also backed by FTX, so they've got financial support in spades.

**Speaking of roadmaps...**

The commercial launch is within the next week or two and they have a whole load of marketing planned around it. Here's just a taste of what's to come marketing wise, straight from the Marketing Director's mouth:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In summary our marketing strategy is now about the commercial launch which is coming up in a couple of weeks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ain't nobody got time for the full plan, BUT I can tell you some of the highlights of what will be happening so you can consider if buying the dip makes sense:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're about to go live with some ads on coingecko  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're launching the commercial version in the next few weeks (details to be announced soon) and we'll have PRs out to all the major crypto/financial news outlets for that  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We are currently reaching out to partner with specific currencies who might like for us to launch a bot trading their pair on binance or FTX. (for example AVAX and many others)   
&gt;  
&gt;and there is a whole bunch of other stuff going on as well, like us just going live on BSC and the marketing for that  
&gt;  
&gt;That will be fun. We have an NFT scavenger hunt type competition for you guys which I'm hoping will be interesting for anyone who likes to game/figure stuff out.  After the launch we will go to more of a user acquisition marketing strat because if we get lots of happy users, UBXT and our tokeneconomy will work all by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would I listen to you, person on the internet I've never met?**

Ok, don't - listen instead to ThatMartiniGuy from this week's live stream if influencer's are your thing: [**https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623**](https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623)

And no, that wasn't a paid for ad. I sent a superchat to genuinely ask what his thoughts were on the project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In Closing**

Bots are going to become common place in cyrpto with the huge influx of crypto traders joining the space daily. There is no doubt in my mind that UpBots can become the market leader. You can go and test out the product now at [upbots.com](https://upbots.com) and see for yourself. They're streets ahead of so many of their rivals and are still, unbelievably, relatively unknown.

Obviously, as always, please do your own research (to help with that have a look at the following links:

[https://upbots.com/](https://upbots.com/)

[https://demo.upbots.com/](https://demo.upbots.com/login)

Telegram if you have any questions: [https://t.me/Upbots](https://t.me/Upbots)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for an answer to the question 'What sets UpBots apart from their competition?' Well, aside from EVERYTHING listed above, UpBots is more focused on bringing different kinds of traders and developers together and rewarding them through our UBXT tokenomics as they use the platform. They also lean more heavily towards automation/copy trading by making it possible for their community members, who don't have time/trading skills to still gain exposure to the markets safely and **only paying fees when they make profits.**

t3_mevrs0,"SafeSatoshi is a Binance Smart Chain token that was created to be un-rugpullable. 50% of its supply got burned to a dead address at the start, and the owner walked away to denounce ownership. Instead this is meant to be a completely community-owned coin.

A decentralized community coin is a great sort of homage to the creator of Bitcoin himself, 'Satoshi'. And the 'Safe' mechanic of the anti-rugpull tokenomics and continual rewards for HODLers is an awesome bonus!!

It has a lively community already:

t3_mfeac8,"Decentralized orderbook based prediction markets that deals with high gas fees, minimal liquidity, and poor UI - PredictX",etc,
t3_mfeac8,"# PredictX: Prediction Markets for DeFi

PredictX is a DeFi protocol that brings prediction markets to DeFi. Centered on automated liquidity and precisely designed incentives, PredictX ensures the best liquidity across all markets while allowing users to win off their predictions on a user-friendly platform.

# Opportunities in the Existing Market:

Prediction markets are online platforms where individuals can set a price on the realization of a future event. These markets encompass a wide range of activities and events from sports betting, politics, to price predictions on stocks like TSLA, and even other events like albums releases, IPO’s, etc. For the average user or trader, a prediction market is an opportunity to make a profit off of the behavior of an event or asset. Sports betting a $200B+ industry is the most popular application of prediction markets, but there are also social markets like politics and global futures markets that are also in the several billions of dollars.

# Challenges with Centralized Prediction Markets:

However, existing markets are highly centralized since centralized gatekeepers like sportsbooks, online betting platforms or applications exercise full control over what markets are offered along with having huge fees (3–10%) involved with each transaction. These centralized gatekeepers dominate the market and extract tons of value from the ecosystem. For example the best known prediction market for political betting, PredictIt, charges a 10% fee for all winnings. These fees make it almost impossible for users to consistently win on their predictions. Not only do centralized players charge exorbitant fees but they are also disincentivized to innovate on a model in which they profit enormously off the user. As a result, they focus their efforts on constantly acquiring new users to replenish the dying ecosystem.

# Problems with Existing Decentralized Prediction Markets:

Plagued by high gas fees, minimal liquidity and poor UI, decentralized platforms like Augur and Polymarket among others have not attracted the volume like that of their centralized counterparts. A big part of this stems from the lack of liquidity, lack of decentralization (needing deposit and withdrawals), and lack of incentives. Incentives for users should be much higher in a decentralized model since there is no centralized middleman collecting massive fees for each transaction. The incentive design for PredictX will play a key role in maximizing the liquidity for markets and optimizing the incentives for all participants.

# PredictX:

Inspired by decentralized prediction market protocols like Augur and Catnip, PredictX is the first DeFi protocol to fully integrate prediction markets on a decentralized platform where users can make predictions with speed and ease. PredictX prioritizes (1) the user experience (2) maximizing liquidity. Our end goal is to create a user-friendly prediction markets platform powered by a truly decentralized protocol that is easily integrated with other DeFi platforms and other blockchains like Polkadot. This means non-custodial, not centralized and open to everyone.

Whether you're a hater or a lover of the recent events I think we all can agree that the money is going to keep *flowing* and that is why im here to give you all my analysis on why I think **$SafeX** is going to be the next **BIG** coin. ***80% liquidity locked to PancakeSwap for 5 years &amp; devs burned ALL team tokens!***

Let me start by saying first, I have hit big and I have lost on many coins here, many being early, many being late. This is all for fun for me and I have had a blast doing it. This is never **EVER** financial advice and you ALWAYS should **DYOR**. That means checking scan websites for addresses, rug pulls, developers, community, ECT. The chart shows very healthy growth. The bscscan is what truly speaks for itself on this one though bois. 

A fork with COMMITTED, TRUE developers, $SafeX is a community driven project made for all the SpaceX lovers. SafeX employs 3 great functions : Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn In each trade, each transaction is taxed and fee is redistributed to all existing holders. With under 1,000 holders and a community that has steel legs &amp; diamonds for hands. I see this rising along with $ElonGate, $SafeMoon &amp; the other greats we've had this year.

Again, always **DYOR** but after what seemed like space-junk all over my feed, this has brought some light to the cockpit.

t3_mf2l3w,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Backed By Binance Cloud,bnb,
t3_mf2l3w,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

Also, XVG recognized and promoted Mandala: [https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734)

Features of Mandala Exchange:

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU
* CCXT, CMC, and gecko within weeks
* Fiat onramp soon
* Native Token MDX - trading fee discounts and future utility
* Will list additional tokens not found on Binance starting very soon
* No need to KYC under 2 BTC per day and also
* Mandala phone apps
* Referral link for 10% of trading fees

You can buy MDX, directly here: [https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX\_USDT](https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX_USDT)

t3_mfejak,🍈 $TREAT🍈 Yourself At TreatDAO!,bnb,
t3_mfejak,"With NFTs (and NFT tokens) going through it's hype mania and BSC/Pancake Swap in the limelight due to ETH's anti-retail fees, let me tell you something about 🍈$TREAT🍈, a governance token for a decentralized ecosystem built on BSC giving creators the tools to tokenize their exclusive content into limited SFW/NSFW NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the platform:

TreatDAO is a place where you can mint and sell your private, limited, one of a kind NFTs. Whether you're completely new to the game or in the top .001% of OnlyFans, $TREAT gives creators the ability to create SFW and NSFW content to distribute to their communities on THEIR terms. With $TREAT being completely decentralized, the creators have complete ownership of their sales and revenue, while $TREAT holders have a say in future model spotlights, new features, partnerships, and more! Last week was the initial launch with the release of Alenaxbt's NFTs and 24 hours after launch, over 33 BNB worth of NFTs were sold! Not bad for a community driven project launched just a month ago :)

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about the tokenomics:

1m $treat supply.

Currently sitting at a 2.3m mcap.

96% airdropped to the community (1200 total recipients, 300 left at the time of writing this post).

6% dev supply.

100% community provided lp 

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion:,

TreatDAO: 

\- no VCs 

\- 100% community driven and funded 

\- working platform release in under 3 weeks 

\- easy to understand product  

Others: 

\- multiple VCs on board  

\- BILLIONS in funding  

\- no platform or working product after 4 years of development

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not gonna do much TA or PA because its primed in both categories (ATH was $5.34, currently $2.30) but I will say this, this is much needed in DEFI and with the success of the initial launch and being first to market on BSC, I think this is just the beginning for 🍈$TREAT🍈. dYOR.

t3_mfe0g8,"I found this coin earlier today and was pleasantly surprised to see that it has an actual website and active dev team in the Telegram.  Here is some information about the token itself:

&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope orbits 547 kilometres (340 miles) above Earth and travels 8 km (5 miles) every second. We're going there, safely.

&gt;Safe Hubble Telescope is a safe moon fork with high potential, while remaining a stable investment opportunity.

&gt;The team behind SAFEHT consists of professional developers with successful moon tokens already under their belt. Their promise for SAFEHT is as follows:

&gt;- A soft cap of 50 BNB and a hard cap of 250 BNB.

&gt;- 250,000,000 tokens available in pre-sale. Unsold tokens will be burnt.

&gt;- An 8% burn, including 4% going to holders and the remaining 4% to be burnt for good.

Here is all of their social media:

Website: https://safeht.xyz

Twitter: https://twitter.com/HubbleSafe

Telegram: https://t.me/safehst

The devs are saying that a partnership announcement is coming up in about 10 hours. With only less than a 100 holders now, this could be a viable moonshot!

edit: sorry forgot the contract lol, kind of the most important part.

t3_mf60sv,"Hi folks - found something which I feel obliged to share. Finally got a memecoin I can HODL without waking up 5 times a night to check the price, dev is based as hell and seems to be pretty damn smart. This token is amazing and is like 4 days old or so - not really seen much shilling of it yet so probably a great time to get in.

They've got a bunch of features I haven't seen any other coins implement, which essentially assure us that as well as not being rugpulled, whales can't dump on our asses and leave us bagholding. Anyone who holds over 0.1% of the max supply (virtually everyone so far I believe) is considered a whale - and they are restricted from selling more than 20% of their stack at a time. Once you've sold, you are unable to sell for another 24 hours. Didn't know this shit was even possible lol. Lots of things in the pipleline, e.g. NFT marketplace and our very own swap. I'm bullish on this token and think some of you may be pretty interested too.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a mid-sale going on currently where you can get 150% of the token for your BNB, join the telegram to see the full details

Just like any project, once we see some success, fudders will arrive to  try to force price dips! We've included an anti-whale dump mechanic where any large holder who owns more than 0.01% of supply can only sell 20% at a time, once per day!

We hope to see all of our members prosper but every project has to overcome the hurdles of intentional fudding from competition, or worries of whale dumps. We hope to creates a healthy long term trajectory.

The 25% holder is the DEV wallet, we will break down a chart soon showing usage of the coins but to summarize, we will use a portion of Master Balls for fan art contests, then split up the remain

&amp;#x200B;

If you own 0.1% of circulating tokens, you are considered a whale.

&amp;#x200B;

That means that you will only be able to sell 20% of your wallet per day.

&amp;#x200B;

If you hold less than 0.1% of all circulating tokens, then you are not a whale, and you can sell as you wish.

Thanos needs to collect the infinity gems (Community) to correct this universe of bad projects. Once Thanos' plan is completed, the SafeThanos community will be able to snap the finger and make low quality DxSale projects disappear.

We will have a community vetting system where when a new DxSale project launches the owner can buy SafeThanos and burn. In return the SafeThanos community will research their project and provide a full community report. We will eventually have a dashboard that users can use to vote and pass the listing of projects, those that don't pass will be wiped out from the universe.

After that you can view in real time what that amount of Moonelon, and like many other scamcoins, is worth over the couple of hours.

In the same time many people buy , that´s not natural to me as an experienced skyrocketer on the safestar and Safemoon launching, i think the other rocket travellers know what i´m meaning. This is just 1 of the many scams.

I can almost guarantee if someone place 102503000000 Moonelons over 24 hours in the pancakeswap field, it just shows between 0.1 and 0.2 BNB like it was 1 hour ago, or even less. I checked around 15 coins on this way the last days since i was scammed a little to much on this scam coins.",bnb,

Mozart Finance is a fork from Goose Finance &amp; astonishing DeFi project running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.

Liquidity LOCKED FOR 8 MONTHS
The fact that they audited code before lunch and removed migrator code is what makes this a one-of-a-kind project.

AUDITED BY [@ImmuneBytes](https://twitter.com/ImmuneBytes) - they have worked on various top crypto projects and have a great understanding of DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, Swissborg, Ox protocol, Uniswap etc.

There is common knowledge about migrator code in pancakeswap masterchef contract. With this option, it is highly possible to do a rug pull. Although they might not do it, the code is still present in their contract and this code is exactly how all the rug pulls were done.

Mozart finance has removed the following migrator code from their contract and audit also proves that contracts are safe. You can see the following code is still present in pancake swap’s contract and Github.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MozartFinance

Their mission is to create a splendid perpetual deflation token that performs like a symphony. Native token PIANO will provide a stable price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. They are not trying to replace the swap &amp; exchange but rather to add value to the system and create a sustainable environment for people to yield farms with high APR.

PIANO token is live on:https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xd46936677b2c1bb696f2b67c55239331e2b7cd42

The team had a bit of a rocky start but they come on top by burning some tokens and taking one for the community
All in all, it's a deflationary token that's getting on the Music NFT bandwagon with an active team and seemingly community and a low marketcap - the kinda thing we've seen get mooned in the past, and after coingecko it will just run and run.

t3_mf1vqf,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),bull,
t3_mf1vqf,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).

*Here are 32 reasons why:*

***Tokenomics***

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.

***Platform***

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.

***Partners***

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.

***Community***

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/)with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t3_mfcslx,"Welcome Shit Coin brought to you by the legend himself, Shitoshi

Symbol: SHIT

Supply: 1 trillion

Features: completely anonymous team, no whitepaper, nothing novel just an ERC-20 token, and unclear and unrealistic roadmap

Motto:  To advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter. 

No innovation. No point. No problem!

Why Shit Coin:  To provide whales, traders, and early adopters a pure shitconin experience. Whales will be given preferential treatement such as early private discounted sales, insider information from dev team etc. To envcourage merchants to adopt ShitCoin as a standard for digital payments. We will ask them nicely with a very well written letter.

t3_mfi1o8,"Digital Reserve Currency (Ticker name #DRC, not to be confused with Dracula Coin) is an ERC 2.0 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to act as a digital store of value with a limited supply of one billion coins and a zero inflation rate. 

Differentiating itself from major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, DRC does not require mining or staking (proof of work and proof of stake are the two primary ways that transactions are processed) to process transactions specific to the coin itself, but instead relies on the already existing Ethereum network. 

Maxim Nurov, the coin's founder and longtime financial advisor and D.C. cryptocurrency advocate, has said that he not only developed the coin with simplicity and ease of adoption in mind, but that he also intends for it to be as accommodating to any future cryptocurrency SEC regulations.

t3_mex5fp,Bitclout - Decentralised social media. And a little present from me to reddit users,bitcoin,
t3_mex5fp,"Hi everyone, I am a long time ghoster on reddit. However after encountering this sweet project here I thought I had to give back to the community and push it more.

Bitclout is being traded with btc. As they both present the same type of revolutionized value.

Bitcoin = a code being valued as money on a decentralised p2p platform

Bitclout = a social platform being value as money on a decentralised p2p platform

And if u think about it, the idea behind the revolution of btc holds in bitclout. It is simply better, more effective and beneficial for these platforms(finance, media) to go through the change into decentralised platforms.

So if u don't know bitclout is a social media based on a decentralised network, where u can purchase ""creator coins"" of every single profile for bitclout token (worth 150$ as of today) . And the profile itself is basically being traded (as if it was a stock or cryptocurrency). Please do notice, it is still in its infant stage, develompent is still ongoing. There are some big partners and investors on this one, and as of right now withdrawing on bitclout is not avaliable, but will be implemented. Those who look for actual moonshots should know they don't happen in a day, so prepare your butts for one hell of a ride. Also advice to read whitepaper. [https://bitclout.com/one\_pager.pdf](https://bitclout.com/one_pager.pdf)

To those who already know whats up, hope you all enjoying the rollercoster grabbing as much as attention media creator coins avaliable on considarebly low market cap. (My gameplan anyway \~\_\~)

Reddit is one of the media sharks on the internet, and still so small (55k market cap) Hop in before this project gets the attention of all medias there are, and joined by mutual reddit's decentralized believers. Who may have found this project through reddit like me. [https://bitclout.com/u/reddit](https://bitclout.com/u/reddit)

Designed to be a store-of-value with properties of strict scarcity, unforgeable costliness and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics characteristics of Bitcoin, where miners compete to expend capital to acquire newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins. Instead of expending capital, Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain. As a result, all units of Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value.  NO PREMINE / NO FUNDS RAISED

A decentralized community coin is a great sort of homage to the creator of Bitcoin himself, 'Satoshi'. And the 'Safe' mechanic of the anti-rugpull tokenomics and continual rewards for HODLers is an awesome bonus!!

to explain, there is no gambling on zenon. DD proves this is jacks baby. he conceived it, funded it and gave birth to it. square crypto and zenon are one in the same. if anyone has questions on this they can be easily answered.

long story short is that theres no way this can fail. for shits sake its nearly the same price as link, orion, and avax... and this thing is still in testing. 

SEC does not allow insider trading, if they saw znn as a security then SEC would go after Jack the way they did with ZUCC's funnymunny. notice how LIBRA is now DIEM... wonder why jack has no direct relation to zenon? if you do youre starting to understand.

SEC does not allow insider trading, BUT theres no fucking rule in crypto buddy, so now ask yourself, why a coin with no working product, amounting to *gasp* ^V^A^porware would be going for such a price when real chains like rose and hbar have working products... jacks makin his buddies fucking rich.

t3_mf9244,"**What is UpBots (UBXT)?**

UpBots is a trading platform (crypto initially but traditional markets coming later this year) that caters to literally everyone. 

Manual traders get all the features they'd usually look for - alert, risk management, iceberg, trailing etc with a beautifully designed UX/UI.

  
Those new to trading can take advantage of two types of bots. Firstly, the UpBots - specially designed AI bots that have already proven to have an incredible return rate. These can be rented using the UpBots native token, UBXT.

Users can also pick a bot from the 'supermarket' of user created bots. Traders can submit their own trading algorithms and if they are approved the are given their own bot. Here's the genius part: **Users can rent your bot and you'll receive 15% of any profit a user makes when using your bot.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Think about how many YouTube/Twitter traders there are in the*** [***cryptosphere.***](https://cryptosphere.Now) ***Now imagine they create their own bot and promote it to their viewers/followers.*** 

***Exactly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the company like?**

Really, really good. Like most of you, I join a lot of Telegrams and like to lurk around them before investing to try and get the cut of the developer's jib. These guys are top class. All the directors/CEOs actively participate in the Telegram chat and will happily take time out of the day to DM you about specific questions, concerns you may have. Not only that but they drop updates and roadmap additions constantly. They're also backed by FTX, so they've got financial support in spades.

**Speaking of roadmaps...**

The commercial launch is within the next week or two and they have a whole load of marketing planned around it. Here's just a taste of what's to come marketing wise, straight from the Marketing Director's mouth:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In summary our marketing strategy is now about the commercial launch which is coming up in a couple of weeks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ain't nobody got time for the full plan, BUT I can tell you some of the highlights of what will be happening so you can consider if buying the dip makes sense:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're about to go live with some ads on coingecko  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're launching the commercial version in the next few weeks (details to be announced soon) and we'll have PRs out to all the major crypto/financial news outlets for that  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We are currently reaching out to partner with specific currencies who might like for us to launch a bot trading their pair on binance or FTX. (for example AVAX and many others)   
&gt;  
&gt;and there is a whole bunch of other stuff going on as well, like us just going live on BSC and the marketing for that  
&gt;  
&gt;That will be fun. We have an NFT scavenger hunt type competition for you guys which I'm hoping will be interesting for anyone who likes to game/figure stuff out.  After the launch we will go to more of a user acquisition marketing strat because if we get lots of happy users, UBXT and our tokeneconomy will work all by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would I listen to you, person on the internet I've never met?**

Ok, don't - listen instead to ThatMartiniGuy from this week's live stream if influencer's are your thing: [**https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623**](https://twitter.com/CrucibleChris/status/1375862012404719623)

And no, that wasn't a paid for ad. I sent a superchat to genuinely ask what his thoughts were on the project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In Closing**

Bots are going to become common place in cyrpto with the huge influx of crypto traders joining the space daily. There is no doubt in my mind that UpBots can become the market leader. You can go and test out the product now at [upbots.com](https://upbots.com) and see for yourself. They're streets ahead of so many of their rivals and are still, unbelievably, relatively unknown.

Obviously, as always, please do your own research (to help with that have a look at the following links:

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/upbots](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/upbots)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for an answer to the question 'What sets UpBots apart from their competition?' Well, aside from EVERYTHING listed above, UpBots is more focused on bringing different kinds of traders and developers together and rewarding them through our UBXT tokenomics as they use the platform. They also lean more heavily towards automation/copy trading by making it possible for their community members, who don't have time/trading skills to still gain exposure to the markets safely and **only paying fees when they make profits.**

I hope this has been helpful and please do shout if you have any questions!",avax,

&gt;Ain't nobody got time for the full plan, BUT I can tell you some of the highlights of what will be happening so you can consider if buying the dip makes sense:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're about to go live with some ads on coingecko  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We're launching the commercial version in the next few weeks (details to be announced soon) and we'll have PRs out to all the major crypto/financial news outlets for that  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We are currently reaching out to partner with specific currencies who might like for us to launch a bot trading their pair on binance or FTX. (for example AVAX and many others)   
&gt;  
&gt;and there is a whole bunch of other stuff going on as well, like us just going live on BSC and the marketing for that  
&gt;  
&gt;That will be fun. We have an NFT scavenger hunt type competition for you guys which I'm hoping will be interesting for anyone who likes to game/figure stuff out.  After the launch we will go to more of a user acquisition marketing strat because if we get lots of happy users, UBXT and our tokeneconomy will work all by itself.

**In Closing**

Bots are going to become common place in cyrpto with the huge influx of crypto traders joining the space daily. There is no doubt in my mind that UpBots can become the market leader. You can go and test out the product now at [upbots.com](https://upbots.com) and see for yourself. They're streets ahead of so many of their rivals and are still, unbelievably, relatively unknown.

Obviously, as always, please do your own research (to help with that have a look at the following links:

If you're looking for an answer to the question 'What sets UpBots apart from their competition?' Well, aside from EVERYTHING listed above, UpBots is more focused on bringing different kinds of traders and developers together and rewarding them through our UBXT tokenomics as they use the platform. They also lean more heavily towards automation/copy trading by making it possible for their community members, who don't have time/trading skills to still gain exposure to the markets safely and **only paying fees when they make profits.**

t3_mfe435,$EYE Behodler Liquidity Queueing - Innovative DEX,1inch,
t3_mfe435,"This isn't a pump and dump aka get rich quick coin. Price hasn't done much over last 10 days which is good as the launchpad is being formed.  I came across a post in the Telegram that leads me to believe the public launch is near (my guess is next month). 

The liquidity queueing beta version was posted https://i.imgur.com/Zuz5Osw.png

Current market cap is about $12,000,000 and price has been between $1-$2 for most of the month. Looking at 4 hour chart it has highest volume in 10 days https://i.imgur.com/xDLhOmN.png and $1.75 has been support for last 4 days as price now attempts to break $2 with ATH at about $2.50

The token is hard capped at 10M supply and will burn on trades on Behodler. Behodler moves to add 100+ tokens in the near future.

You can think of $EYE as like the next 1inch which has a market cap of $600,000,000 right now. Of course we all know about Uniswap and its 14 billion dollar market cap. This makes $EYE at 10 million market cap seem like a steal. 

Main benefit of using $EYE will be cheaper fees. When you see someone complain about Uniswap fees then in the future we can direct them to Behodler which uses $EYE.

For whales who buy a ton to be part of the liquidity. Users are rewarded for time waiting (or staked) in the queue with $EYE tokens on an hourly basis. There is no claiming your reward for staking as it's automatically put into your wallet. There is single-sided pooling so you don't have to do an Eth pair to pool.

Nerd details here https://github.com/WeiDaiEcosystem/LiquidQueue

Right now there are 139,144 $EYE on Uniswap and at $2 that is $278,288. With the liquidity queueing beta coming up which leads into the public launch we could see a nice pump. Who doesn't love lower fees along with getting your rewards deposited straight into your wallet? While knowing $EYE is capped at 10,000,000 and gets burned with use of Behodler. 

Due to being $12,000,000 market cap you will see buying and selling and price bouncing $1.75-$2.15 until it breaks one way. I am guessing up as the platform is unique and if they do offer 100+ pairs with cheap gas and good liquidity then price will go up a lot. With it being a bigger market cap those with dozens of ETH can easily get in and out without moving the price as much as you would in a small cap coin.  

Bonus: $EYE is also closely tied to $SCX [which has been going up](https://app.astrotools.io/pair-explorer/0xf047ee812b21050186f86106f6cabdfec35366c6)",1inch,

t3_mf9244,"**What is UpBots (UBXT)?**

UpBots is a trading platform (crypto initially but traditional markets coming later this year) that caters to literally everyone. 

Manual traders get all the features they'd usually look for - alert, risk management, iceberg, trailing etc with a beautifully designed UX/UI.

  
Those new to trading can take advantage of two types of bots. Firstly, the UpBots - specially designed AI bots that have already proven to have an incredible return rate. These can be rented using the UpBots native token, UBXT.

Users can also pick a bot from the 'supermarket' of user created bots. Traders can submit their own trading algorithms and if they are approved the are given their own bot. Here's the genius part: **Users can rent your bot and you'll receive 15% of any profit a user makes when using your bot.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Think about how many YouTube/Twitter traders there are in the*** [***cryptosphere.***](https://cryptosphere.Now) ***Now imagine they create their own bot and promote it to their viewers/followers.*** 

***Exactly.***

**What are the company like?**

Really, really good. Like most of you, I join a lot of Telegrams and like to lurk around them before investing to try and get the cut of the developer's jib. These guys are top class. All the directors/CEOs actively participate in the Telegram chat and will happily take time out of the day to DM you about specific questions, concerns you may have. Not only that but they drop updates and roadmap additions constantly. They're also backed by FTX, so they've got financial support in spades.

**Speaking of roadmaps...**

The commercial launch is within the next week or two and they have a whole load of marketing planned around it. Here's just a taste of what's to come marketing wise, straight from the Marketing Director's mouth:

t3_meyp8l,Alchemy (NFT DAO Creator) My first call was ⚗️ @ ¢0.80,cash,
t3_meyp8l,"#ALCHEMY


####How it works 
Alchemy lets users take any NFTs that meet the ERC721 standard (almost all) and create a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation which owns the underlying NFT(s). The DAO is controlled by the DAO’s governance tokens, able to be freely traded and transferred, creating liquid markets for ownership. All tokens are worth 1 vote each, and so owning a token gives you both governance rights letting you vote what to do with the NFTs as well as claim rights for NFT sales.

______________________________________________
###Core features

####Buyouts
NFTs can be purchased from the DAO directly by simply transferring the ETH buyout for that NFT to the contract, purchasing the NFT from the DAO. The price for each and every NFT can be set to any value by the NFT DAO allowing for targeted prices while keeping the governance token value as the collective value for all NFTs.

The DAO can also set a buyout price for the whole DAO to be purchased. Allowing for speculators to purchase and hold ownership in collections then profit by selling the collection for more later.

####Burning
At any time the governance tokens for the NFT DAO can be burned for a proportional amount from the NFT DAOs Ether balance. This allows holders to redeem their profits after a DAO buyout or to exit assuming some NFTs have sold but theres no liquid market for the tokens.

####Fund Raise and Fund Management
The DAO can issue new tokens for itself to be able to fund raise to purchase more NFTs. By setting a value for the raise and amount to sell, the DAO can mint governance tokens to be purchased by others in exchange for ETH which can then be used to purchase further NFTs to generate more value.

By allowing for the DAO to dilute the stake in exchange for raising funds to the Treasury, more users can join without holders needing to sell, funds can be used to purchase NFTs, fund costs for like marketing or managing the DAOs and create whole Decentralized Autonomous Organisations around the held NFTs owned and managed by the community. DAOs can take the form as their own funds, collectives or even common good pools, owning say Ethereum.eth and letting the DAO allow projects to register subdomains, generate their own fees from leasing domains to donate and to prevent squatting.

####Governance
The holders are able to create proposals to set buyout prices, fundraise, buy NFTs, sell NFTs, transfer/loan NFTs or do any other action that can be done on chain. Proposals are voted on by holders and allow for Decentralized Community Ownership and control. 

_____________________________________________

####ALCH token
Every buyout that happens for an NFT that was owned by an Alchemy based NFT DAO sends a small fee to the ALCH DAO which splits the fee between the ALCH Treasury and to a staker contract. ALCH holders can stake ALCH tokens to earn these fees, which as the usage for Alchemy DAOs grows so will these fees.

####ALCH also controls the Alchemy Treasury, where holders can vote for how the funds should be used to manage and grow the protocol. By allowing for holders to vote as well as have a direct interest in the growth which drives fee revenue, the system incentivizes the best possible uses for funds that will benefit the protocol and the holders symbiotically.


####Distribution
The ALCH supply will be 10,000,000 with the following allocations


2,000,000 Team Multisig

1,000,000 Founder and team allocation

400,000 Strategic Investors and partners - will be moved to a decentralized VC model later

200,000 Growth and Community

400,000 future devs, team and advisors

__________________________________________

####Creator Airdrop

100,000 - 500,000

Airdrop to early users that create NFT DAOs for their NFTs. These users are the base for the ecosystem and need to pay the costs to deploy the contracts aswell as be willing to decentralize their ownership. Based on DAOs deployed, the market and participants, this allocation may continue to be able to incentivize DAOs to be created or allocated to further community growth.


####Community Airdrop

2,000,000

Airdrop to users that hold NFTs. These users are able to take a claim for the governance for the protocol and distribute to the core market that Alchemy will generate revenue from. We have assuned that only .5x NFT holders will claim. So we have set the reward at 2x the amount needed to allow all holders to claim, so if users leave their claim too late, there may be none left. Any unclaimed tokens will be sent to the Treasury.

####Liquidity Providers

500,000
A small allocation to ALCH/ETH LP stakers to allow for liquidity.

####Treasury

5,000,000

2,000,000 after launch once the team doesnt have majority control for the DAO

3,000,000 slowly vested for 2y to allow for continuous cash flow for early growth

t3_mfc10t,"There has been a huge short on $MOB Mobilecoin shooting up the interest rate for borrowing on margin to 3000% annualized. Word is spreading around in the last couple hours and the price is already skyrocketing. Despite that, I think this is still very early as there is not much coverage of this going on at the moment and the price rising rapidly with every minute.

**So better act fast on this and get on the train**

People are talking about not selling their $MOB and doing a short squeeze on it. This can get huge once word starts spreading like a wildfire.

You can check the amount of currently 20M $MOB (@15$) borrowed which is a massive amount, at the FTX lending page.

To get more info, best to check out the live feed on twitter:

[https://twitter.com/search?q=%24mob&amp;f=live](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24mob&amp;f=live)

Regardless of this, $MOB is a solid project with the developers from Signal app and speculations that it gets integrated soon into the Signal App as a digital cash which would be massive. Remember a couple months ago when the whole FB/Whatsapp fiasco resulted in an influx of new Signal Users. 

Additionally it got a $30M funding from Binance Labs which gives me confidence in a big exchange listing coming soon. 

You can get $MOB basically only at FTX currently (also BigOne and Hotbit but low volume)",cash,

t3_mfan69,"Aleph.im (""ALEPH"") - Introductory write-up",cosmos,
t3_mfan69,"**What is Aleph.im?**

Aleph.im is a cross-chain network featuring decentralised cloud storage, cloud computing and a decentralised identity framework. Note that Aleph.im is not a blockchain but a decentralised network which has cross-chain compatibility with a number of smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos (full list can be found at: [https://aleph.im/#/chains](https://aleph.im/#/chains)). 

The developers of Aleph.im state that Aleph.im’s core mission is to help support dApps and protocols in achieving a fully decentralised architecture. This is done by providing decentralised databases with accompanying storage, computation and a decentralised identification framework.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

**What does Aleph.im have in plan for the future?**

Aleph.im has a sizeable agenda for 2021 and some of their notable targets for the year include:

* **GDPR compliance:** Implementing a right to be forgotten feature;
* **Channel sharding:** Sharding allows projects to create their own dedicated cloud clusters allowing channel’s to have accurate control over their scaling capacity. This will prevent performance from being affected by other projects running on Aleph.im; and
* **Wallet integrations:** Integration of wallets across the Polkadot, Cosmos &amp; Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

**Who are Aleph.im’s competitors?**

As a decentralised cloud storage provider, Aleph.im is discussed as competing with Filecoin. However, it should be noted that Filecoin is useful for those wanting to store large files, contrasting to Aleph.im who focuses on supercharging the DeFi ecosystem by allowing its dApps and protocols to migrate the centralised parts of their stack from cloud to decentralised computation and database services. Therefore, it could be explored that they are complementary as opposed to competing. Quoting the developers of Aleph.im: 

“A team could decide to build a dApp with the following stack:

* Smart contracts on Ethereum;
* Database, computing and DID on Aleph.im; and
* Large files such as videos and pdf’s on Filecoin.”

As a decentralised cloud computing provider, Aleph.im finds competition in the form of Akash Network. Akash Network is solely cloud computing and is restricted to the Cosmos ecosystem, where Aleph.im is also integrated into. Moreover, it is a Layer-2 solution which can be overlaid on the multitude of smart contract platforms it is integrated with.

Aleph.im’s comprehensive cloud network has a number of features that other platforms operate independently.

**Where can you buy ALEPH tokens?**

ALEPH tokens are available on a number of exchanges. The majority of the tokens volume goes through KuCoin (ALEPH/USDT), Uniswap (ALEPH/WETH) and MXC.COM (ALEPH/USDT).

As you may be aware, the KuCoin hack that occurred in September 2020 saw the majority of affected projects upgrade their tokens and roll-back these transactions to ensure that token-holders were not impacted. Like many other projects, Aleph.im did the same with their ALEPH token and with the support of the partner exchanges, v1 tokens were swapped out in place of v2 tokens. However, Hotbit did not forward the migrated ALEPH v2 tokens to its customers and continued to allow deposits and trading for the deprecated ALEPH v1 token. Therefore, if you are interested in ALEPH, please ensure that you do not purchase them from Hotbit.

**Conclusions**

Aleph.im appears to look to compete with a number of existing platforms but looks to offer a more comprehensive service where others focus on only one specific. Being easily compatible with a majority of the large smart contract platforms will be a strong addition compared to platforms that are restricted to their existing platform.

There are fair criticisms of the platform's current circulating supply but even at its fully diluted market cap there is significant scope for growth which is always beneficial from an investors point of view.

By way of disclosure, ALEPH comprises 0.5% of my portfolio and therefore I hope you can appreciate that I am pretty impartial to it as its growth will not materially impact me.

t3_mfan69,"Aleph.im (""ALEPH"") - Introductory write-up",neo,
t3_mfan69,"**What is Aleph.im?**

Aleph.im is a cross-chain network featuring decentralised cloud storage, cloud computing and a decentralised identity framework. Note that Aleph.im is not a blockchain but a decentralised network which has cross-chain compatibility with a number of smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos (full list can be found at: [https://aleph.im/#/chains](https://aleph.im/#/chains)). 

The developers of Aleph.im state that Aleph.im’s core mission is to help support dApps and protocols in achieving a fully decentralised architecture. This is done by providing decentralised databases with accompanying storage, computation and a decentralised identification framework.

Currently, 60% of all Ethereum nodes are run using centralised cloud service providers (25% of all Ethereum nodes are run on Amazon Web Services) which creates a significant point of failure as centralised cloud providers could voluntarily restrict its services from the blockchain, for financial gain or legislative changes, resulting in the majority of Ethereum and other blockchains going offline.

Aleph.im is decentralised and still as fast as centralised databases with confirmations in 50ms benefitting from the unique blend of onchain and offchain decentralised technologies that comprise the network.

Data that is stored using Aleph.im is stored on the network’s nodes and messages are stored onchain. It is also set to private by default and users can replicate their data to IPFS if necessary.

Aleph.im’s network will consist of two different nodes, the latter of which is to be released later in 2021.

Core channel nodes will function for network validation and security (via staking), management of the network and dispatching the workload. They can also provide services that the network requires such as database, file storage and computing services but this is optional and not required by the nodes. They will also verify resource nodes and ensure that they do their job correctly (and decide which operators should be paid).

Resource nodes will only exist to provide operational services such as database, file storage and computing services. These nodes will not have to stake any tokens and will be rewarded solely on their operational contribution. 

Note that in 3Q20, PikcioAG - the founders of PikcioChain fell victim to a confidence trick which saw them lose the majority of their funds rendering them unable to operate. PikcioChain created a browser that combines privacy surfing, secure P2P chat, cryptocurrency wallet and digital identity management. As part of their winding up operations, PikcioAG held conversations with Aleph.im and noted that Aleph.im would be the most appropriate place for the technology to continue in. This saw an airdrop of ALEPH tokens for holders of PikcioChain’s native token.

Note that running a node on Aleph.im is quite lucrative at the moment. As per [https://account.aleph.im/#/](https://account.aleph.im/#/), with a current 46 active nodes, nodes receive c.326 ALEPH per day and c.9,783 ALEPH per month on average. Even if an individual was to utilise Node Forge (who Aleph.im have partnered with to), a platform that offers node managing services (and charges c.$300), they could still see a 10.7x return on their monthly expense. Running a node requires a minimum of 200,000 ALEPH. Please also note that there are no guarantees on how long the ALEPH yield will persist for as well as what may happen in terms of price movement which will both impact the return for running a node.

**Who is in Aleph.im’s team?**

Jonathan Schemoul is the founder and CEO at Aleph.im which he founded after leaving his role as community developer at Nuls - a smart contract platform. During his time at Nuls he created a block explorer, multiple dApps and SDKs for both Python and JavaScript. Jonathan also spent more than a decade at JMSI as a consultant. His prolonged stint at JMSI saw him utilise a number of coding languages and working on projects including sensor network management and creating an indoor geolocation platform.

Claudio Pascariello is the co-founder of Aleph.im and the head of design. He has held roles as a senior designer since 2017 including those at Springbok Agency (a top ten digital agency in the Benelux region), Essentiel Antwerp (Belgian fashion brand) and Nuls demonstrating his depth and breadth within design.

Ashley Richardson is the head of strategy at Aleph.im. She is a qualified attorney with a law degree from American University Washington College of Law. Ashley is the Managing Director at MDUBB Financial LLC - a consulting firm that supports clients working in fields impacting the United States DoD. She also found her own business for legal and strategic business consulting for blockchain.

**What is the ALEPH token required for and how is it distributed?**

The ALEPH token is required for the payment of services on Aleph.im. Although storage nodes can request their services paid in any cryptocurrency of their choice, payments will be taken in ALEPH and converted thereafter.

Aleph.im conducted a token supply reduction which halved the total supply of ALEPH tokens to 500m. 70% of these burned tokens were originally allocated for a token sale to support funding that was no longer required, the remainder of the burned tokens were from various different pools.

Note that Aleph.im currently has a circulating supply of 17% according to CoinMarketCap. This is notably lower than other cryptocurrencies but the significant amount of tokens are locked up and detailed as follows:

* Company Pool (150m ALEPH) - not explicitly stated but assume this is for the team. From September 2020, 2.5m ALEPH are unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain available;
* Business Dev. Pool (120m ALEPH) - completely unlocked pool available for use based on the development roadmap;
* Incentive Pool (100m ALEPH) - approximately 55m still available to incentivise node operators, liquidity pool providers and staking;
* Marketing Pool (60m ALEPH) - used for marketing and branding. From January 2021, 1.0m ALEPH are unlocked each month, half of any unused tokens will be moved to the Innovation Pool (with the other half remaining in the Marketing Pool);
* Innovation Pool (50m ALEPH) - fund projects and provide grants for future projects. From July 2021, 0.9m ALEPH will be unlocked each month, any unused tokens will remain unlocked; and
* NULS Foundation Pool (20m ALEPH) - ensure future collaboration between the NULS Foundation and Aleph.im. The vesting schedule for these tokens are yet to be confirmed.

ALEPH is currently hosted on Ethereum (ERC-20), NEO (NEP-5), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Nuls (NRC-20). This is a temporary measure and it shall eventually be hosted on Aleph.im itself with bridges towards the underlying chain assets.

**Who is Aleph.im working with?**

Subsequent to the integrations with a number of market leading smart contract platforms, Aleph.im have made a number of breakthroughs making partnerships with platforms including:

* **Starname:** The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;
* **Exeedme:** The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;
* **Decentr:** The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;
* **Orion Protocol:** The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and
* **Synaps:** The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.

t3_mf46qh,"$LOT A fun Token, suffering from Shitcoins",pot,
t3_mf46qh,"&amp;#x200B;

Dear Redditors,

hereby I may present to you the coin of my choice. $LOT Lottery Token.

Before you read any further, be advised that this is not just a promotional post, but a reminder to all of the smaller investors regarding shit/memecoins.

&amp;#x200B;

So my journey with this coin started with DxSale, the presale platform you know? That’s flooded with all the food and SAFE coins? Yeah.

So I was trying to get into presale after reading everything about their tokenomics and joining the community in Telegram. Well well, of course everyone says their coin is sold in seconds, but let me tell you as soon as I hit that refresh button, the presale was over. Never had been in a presale before so I thought that’s normal to be honest.

After that the launch on Pancakeswap started and i joined in finally.

The following hours the coin had a healthy chart and a nice and moderate gain of interest.

So far so good, the team started to work on website and all the stuff the people were asking to be improved. Meanwhile the community took action and promoted the coin on several websites as well as reddit. That. Was. Maybe. A dumb move.

Because, here on reddit in the last few weeks, shitcoins and memecoins have rised from their dark underground and just flooded the forums with pump and dumps. Of course people joined this coin aswell after promotion and let it pump a good bit. But after a while all of these people were leaving the coin to join another good pump.

This has caused several good community members to leave the coin aswell.

We thought, okay nice the biggest whales have left and the tokens are spread nice and evenly around the community. But this pump and dump action has led this to a stagnant bottom. People are believing this is just another Safemoon copycat without heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you, the team around Edith, Tim, Noah and all the others are working their asses off pleasing the community, while working on stuff behind the scenes and they are so generous and community driven. It makes my heart tear, that their nice idea of a token that rewards holders gets stomped by shillers and fudders.

Its not a copycat of any coin, the contract was selfwritten and accomplished and I want their work to be worth something.

It is a lottery token, which means there is a 6% tax on transactions, 2% are burned, 2% are delegated to holders and 2% go into the lottery pot. As soon as the pot hits 0.2% of market cap it is paid out to one lucky holder. And it does not ! depend on how much you hold, whales are not having any benefits. Even the smaller average investor has a chance to win the pot. So far the pot has been paid out like every 2-3 hours, unlike $lottery (this coin is probably also well known) where there is only a winner a day and tokens get drawn from holders.

Of course, there is a minimum amount you need to hold but this is only due to safety reasons so you can’t just put 1 coin in few wallets and participate.

There were originally 2.500.000 Tokens released, 50% got burned, 10% got delegated to devs for marketing and stuff (which they are already using to promote their thingy) and 20% got locked into pancakeswap liquidity. That’s brought us 1.250.000 tokens of which there have already been 50k burned. So we are sitting at a max supply (no more minting) of 1.200.000 !

Of course, the use case of the token is in talks and there has been several ideas to further implement the coin in other systems, thus not only being a lottery token.

Honestly, as the token started I’ve won myself and there is a list of winners all the time, they have been all celebrating in the telegram chat like crazy. It was a nice time seeing all this happy faces and everyone was generous, having the time of their lives, because well, its still lottery you know.

&amp;#x200B;

But this has kind of been destroyed buy all this shitcoin shillings, which made me mad as hell.

So if you are kind enough, check out our small subreddit community at r/lottery_token to get all the infos you need or have a glance of what we are doing. All the whales have left so community is the main holder at the moment.

Thank you for your read and see you on the other side 😉",pot,

t3_mfi1o8,"Digital Reserve Currency (Ticker name #DRC, not to be confused with Dracula Coin) is an ERC 2.0 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to act as a digital store of value with a limited supply of one billion coins and a zero inflation rate. 

Differentiating itself from major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, DRC does not require mining or staking (proof of work and proof of stake are the two primary ways that transactions are processed) to process transactions specific to the coin itself, but instead relies on the already existing Ethereum network. 

Maxim Nurov, the coin's founder and longtime financial advisor and D.C. cryptocurrency advocate, has said that he not only developed the coin with simplicity and ease of adoption in mind, but that he also intends for it to be as accommodating to any future cryptocurrency SEC regulations.

t3_mf5fl4,"Zenon is implementing a fully decentralized dual-coin mechanism. The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.

What is it:

Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it:

This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.


Just looking at the chart and timeline is promising enough.  ZNN has an organic and strong growth rate and it's valuation is steady and we are still only in pre alpha.

t1_gsmnwp8,"Escrow used to be deep web thing only, for illicit practices because everyone wanted to steal each other funds in the early days of crypto. 

(now it's through memecoins lmao don't shoot me)  

Anyway, yeah escrow like this is very underrated. It used to be something the sender of the funds couldn't control but more a moderator of a site so an implementation of escrow like this is very new.  

In my own opinion, this is as comfy to hold as holding UNI tokens. Both are game-changing in their own ways.

For people not knowing what ESCROW is:
It’s essentially sending money to a middle man that holds your money safe until you’re comfortable into releasing the funds to the person you’re paying it into.

Most escrows used to be that the middleman was the judge whether the money would be send to the receiver yes or no, this could still be dangerous.

t3_mfbwcc,Why ETHBOX is important.,uniswap,
t3_mfbwcc,"Sup y'all.  
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves   
So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. 

Using the cryptographically unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

# Okay cool but this is why I actually like this one:

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:**   


&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*   
Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee. 

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure. 

**Price**: $0.80

**Contract:** 0x33840024177a7daca3468912363bed8b425015c5 (always verify)

**Token supply:** 65 Million

t3_mfb9mt,$FVT Finance Vote - The Consensus Layer for DeFi - $7M MCAP,uniswap,
t3_mfb9mt,"We all like DeFi. We live, shit and breathe with DeFi applications nowadays, but **despite our love for them we also need to admit some of these applications release terrible governance tokens** that are terribly flawed in their implementation.

Being able to keep up with new promising technological developments is nearly impossible nowadays, we need a reliable way to collectively decide which projects are great and which are not.

**I have found a solution to this problem: $FVT Finance.vote**

**Finance.vote** **is the consensus layer for DeFi**. It is a governance platform designed to introduce quadratic voting technologies and mechanisms for price discovery to decentralised finance. The platform pushes prediction markets and DAOs into new territories, where users can earn tokens for accurate price predictions and participate in governance decisions. Finance.vote is DeFi 2.0.

**Before you can engage in voting activity on finance.vote, you must acquire a minimum of 100 $FVT, which will be sent to the identity minting address and burnt**, which assigns voting rights to a user Ethereum address. This makes it so that every single person who wants to vote will push the price higher by effectively burning those tokens.

With this project we can finally start filtering out the scams and DeFi tokens with terrible tokenomics by reaching consensus within the community in a decentralized manner.

**The $FVT token is sitting at a market cap of only $10M**, and considering the fact it solves an important problem we all deal with, that 10M is tiny and this project deserves much more attention.

Their roadmap is also super ambitious and their team seems to have the credentials to back it up, so this seems like a no-brainer.

t3_mf2ma4,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Second Chance for BNB!,uniswap,
t3_mf2ma4,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

Also, XVG recognized and promoted Mandala: [https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734)

Features of Mandala Exchange:

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU
* CCXT, CMC, and gecko within weeks
* Fiat onramp soon
* Native Token MDX - trading fee discounts and future utility
* Will list additional tokens not found on Binance starting very soon
* No need to KYC under 2 BTC per day and also
* Mandala phone apps
* Referral link for 10% of trading fees

t3_mez4bz,SwapDEX - The next 100x gem?,uniswap,
t3_mez4bz,"Okay, before I start I will make it clear that I am not affiliated with the development, marketing or mod team of SwapDEX, I am simply a long time investor who is super bullish on what the future holds with SDX and with some of the gems I've received off this board I'd like to give one back.

# SwapDEX - features two trading platforms. The swap exchange and the decentralized exchange.

The exchange has 2 key features that get me excited. The first being its aggregator which in testing gave the best adjusted price (amount received after fees and gas) 72% of the time when compared to Uniswap, 1inch, Dex Ag and Paraswap. Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

If you are interested in reading about the Swap exchange or the DEX, feel free to click this link [here](https://swapdexoldaccount.medium.com/the-beginning-of-something-special-6dd2a84aa7c8). Generic to other exchanges, although this is a primary feature of the SwapDEX project, I feel it isn't nearly the most thing I am attracted to with this product.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers!

This is the first time I’ve written a post on here I’m not shilling a shitcoin more wondering what people’s opinions are on MDEX. 

It’s a decentralised exchange similar to pancake swap and uniswap but on the heco chain, it was only launched in January but since then has passed uniswap in popularity and consistently has a higher trading volume. It’s total value locked is over 2 billion yet the market cap is 241 million so plenty of room to grow. 

Currently 76 million coins in circulation with a strong buy back and burn and reward system for incentivising long term holds. 

The trading figures and value locked in this exchange along with its low market cap are making me wonder if I’m missing something that is keeping the price low or if I’m right in thinking this coin could be genuinely set to take off similar to cake and sushi.

As far as I've understood, the money goes to the one selling them, but when you swap coin on for example uniswap or pancakeswap, who am I swapping the money with? Besides, all the research I've done so far regarding crypto has been in English, since there's more info, and that's not my native language but I understand it, but find it hard to explain the info in another language, and google translate doesn't really help.

I explain the bigger the exchange the less the risk but the less the return, but to be patient and not greedy and research! It took me a year to even dabble in most alt coins back in the day. And only this year I’ve started on UNIswap and all that jazz and I’ve been doing crypto since 2014/15 

I mean if a newbie is on this subreddit than good luck to them. I’ve already had a friend who started with crypto come to me crying because they bought in some shit coin meme thing because they got caught up in the hype and they had no exit plan or any idea what there were doing. They went straight to BTC to buying ETH and buying some rando coin through UNI swap and didn’t even know what a gas fee was 

Shyte coins are huge gambles but they are pretty easy to spot on here. Most of the time once they hit reddit it’s too late anyway. You have to find them within minutes on 4 chan or telegram and be selling within an hour or two. It seems once they get on reddit 90% of them are trying to shill because they are about to pull as soon as you buy or they already have pulled 

Read the comments. look how old accounts are. Read the charts. It will settle down soon. People are going wild. Remember how many alt coins there were in 2017??? It was insane. Every hour a new one. Same thing. Buy in early. I lost and made so much stupid money back then. Of course lost it all. It just took one bad buy in from a scam coin. Lol.

Gas fees will be really reduced and user interaction would be seamless as the exchange will set the correct slippage % automatically which makes a great user experience.

Now, ways to make passive income:

1 - You holding FEG in your wallet, you will automatically receive 1% of any transaction whether someone sells or buys feg, 1% is shared to the holders in ratio to how much they are holding. More you hold, more rewards

2 - Staking, you would be able to stake your FEG which is used for transaction validation that helps securing the network. You get rewarded 0.1% of all sell transactions in either ETH or BNB depending on what side you bought token (FYI FEG can be bought on the ERC side (Uniswap), and BSC Side (PancakeSwap).

3 - 1 Sided liquidity. Normally you would have to pair a token for liquidity, not here, you can have 1 sided liquidity. You will also be rewarded in ETH or BNB depending on what side your providing liquidity in. At the moment, the % of how much you will receive in ETH or BNB has not been finalised and will be announced once it has in our future AMA's.

Investors are in here for the long run, compounding their rewards over time and wish to find financial freedom from passive income. With THREE ways of making passive income, losing just 2 zeros (x100) in the next 2-3 months is easily possible and thats a super conservative estimate. Just don't expect this to hit $1 in the next 10 years. But getting to $0.0001 (x1,000,000) in 10 years could be possible with token burning in sustained high volume (very ambitious though).

We are all waiting for FegEx (the exchange to come out). When that comes out you can do your staking and one sided liquidity. There will be videos and FAQ guides on how to do these once FegEx is out which will be in the next 3 days.

Our community has a 24/7 live call going in our telegram group for anyone who has questions, speculations, curiosity. I kept my FEG due to the community helping me understand the project motivating me to buy more. [https://t.me/FEGchat](https://t.me/FEGchat)

So far, all you see about FEG on Social Media other than the FEGToken Twitter page has been organic. Meaning the only marketing you see about FEG is done by the community.

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage.

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

t3_mfb9mt,$FVT Finance Vote - The Consensus Layer for DeFi - $7M MCAP,ethereum,
t3_mfb9mt,"We all like DeFi. We live, shit and breathe with DeFi applications nowadays, but **despite our love for them we also need to admit some of these applications release terrible governance tokens** that are terribly flawed in their implementation.

Being able to keep up with new promising technological developments is nearly impossible nowadays, we need a reliable way to collectively decide which projects are great and which are not.

**I have found a solution to this problem: $FVT Finance.vote**

**Finance.vote** **is the consensus layer for DeFi**. It is a governance platform designed to introduce quadratic voting technologies and mechanisms for price discovery to decentralised finance. The platform pushes prediction markets and DAOs into new territories, where users can earn tokens for accurate price predictions and participate in governance decisions. Finance.vote is DeFi 2.0.

**Before you can engage in voting activity on finance.vote, you must acquire a minimum of 100 $FVT, which will be sent to the identity minting address and burnt**, which assigns voting rights to a user Ethereum address. This makes it so that every single person who wants to vote will push the price higher by effectively burning those tokens.

With this project we can finally start filtering out the scams and DeFi tokens with terrible tokenomics by reaching consensus within the community in a decentralized manner.

**The $FVT token is sitting at a market cap of only $10M**, and considering the fact it solves an important problem we all deal with, that 10M is tiny and this project deserves much more attention.

Their roadmap is also super ambitious and their team seems to have the credentials to back it up, so this seems like a no-brainer.

t3_mez4bz,SwapDEX - The next 100x gem?,ethereum,
t3_mez4bz,"Okay, before I start I will make it clear that I am not affiliated with the development, marketing or mod team of SwapDEX, I am simply a long time investor who is super bullish on what the future holds with SDX and with some of the gems I've received off this board I'd like to give one back.

# SwapDEX - features two trading platforms. The swap exchange and the decentralized exchange.

The exchange has 2 key features that get me excited. The first being its aggregator which in testing gave the best adjusted price (amount received after fees and gas) 72% of the time when compared to Uniswap, 1inch, Dex Ag and Paraswap. Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

If you are interested in reading about the Swap exchange or the DEX, feel free to click this link [here](https://swapdexoldaccount.medium.com/the-beginning-of-something-special-6dd2a84aa7c8). Generic to other exchanges, although this is a primary feature of the SwapDEX project, I feel it isn't nearly the most thing I am attracted to with this product.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

t3_mf10am,"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",ethereum,
t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

Does anyone know anything about how Cryptocurrency Exchanges like Coinbase Pro, Binance and Gemini use this data or how they store or auto verify it? I need someone to reassure me of what happens with my data. Or should I use another exchange like Kraken Pro? I am not sure which one is the best for trading and HODLing.

t3_mfi5gu,Amplify your DOGEcoin value effortlessly NOW!,ethereum,
t3_mfi5gu," Many **Dogecoin HODLers** are looking forward for DOGE to hit $1. Given the current value at the time of writing, it is $0.0537 and hitting $1 means close to 19x. This also means if you had invested $100k in DOGE now, you will getting $1,900.00 when it moonshot to $1.

Impressive right?

What if there is a much better way to amplify more than 19x for a traditional DOGE, BTC, LTC algorithm lover? Your answer is none other than **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin!**

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves   
So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. 

Using the cryptographically unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

# Okay cool but this is why I actually like this one:

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:**   


&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*   
Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee. 

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

As of right now there is only a telegram page, this project has super low exposure, this is my candidate for a moon shot because the holders remains at 200 with supply pretty evenly distributed, I think if the devs push out what they intend to do in a timely manor the price could appreciate pretty easily, what made me like the project is the fact that I’m a front end dev and I’ve never seen a site look the way theirs does it’s pretty awesome, I have some respect for their front end engineer so without further ado I’ll leave some more info down below

“not counting tokens burnt”

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers! This project is super unique and the site showcases its potential as a low cap gem! ATH was around 30$ pretty good price entry right now hope to see you all at the bar! 🍹❤️

t3_mf8zh7,Honest question,one,
t3_mf8zh7,"Im sort of new in reddit and even newer in this subreddit, but I hope someone can answer me this question.

So I was talking with some family members about cryptocurrencies since I just got into it and I find it interesting, and then one of them asks me ""where does the money go when you buy a coin?"" and I really didn't know how to answer them lol. As far as I've understood, the money goes to the one selling them, but when you swap coin on for example uniswap or pancakeswap, who am I swapping the money with? Besides, all the research I've done so far regarding crypto has been in English, since there's more info, and that's not my native language but I understand it, but find it hard to explain the info in another language, and google translate doesn't really help.

Hope someone could help me with this and thank you in advance! wish you all a good week ahead!! :)",one,
t1_gsmd3si,"Anytime someone is new on crypto I tell them to stick with Coinbase pro and big exchanges like that. When they are ready they can go onto binance, then kucoin. Thennnn when they are confident they can look into uniswap/not/pancake swap at their own risk 

I explain the bigger the exchange the less the risk but the less the return, but to be patient and not greedy and research! It took me a year to even dabble in most alt coins back in the day. And only this year I’ve started on UNIswap and all that jazz and I’ve been doing crypto since 2014/15 

I mean if a newbie is on this subreddit than good luck to them. I’ve already had a friend who started with crypto come to me crying because they bought in some shit coin meme thing because they got caught up in the hype and they had no exit plan or any idea what there were doing. They went straight to BTC to buying ETH and buying some rando coin through UNI swap and didn’t even know what a gas fee was 

Shyte coins are huge gambles but they are pretty easy to spot on here. Most of the time once they hit reddit it’s too late anyway. You have to find them within minutes on 4 chan or telegram and be selling within an hour or two. It seems once they get on reddit 90% of them are trying to shill because they are about to pull as soon as you buy or they already have pulled 

Read the comments. look how old accounts are. Read the charts. It will settle down soon. People are going wild. Remember how many alt coins there were in 2017??? It was insane. Every hour a new one. Same thing. Buy in early. I lost and made so much stupid money back then. Of course lost it all. It just took one bad buy in from a scam coin. Lol.

Seriously at this point I’m going to make a NFT of my own of my blind cat. I have the best image of his face with a trippy color wall behind him. If anyone is keen enough to buy my blind cat then good for them. He will give you absolutely nothing he is an asshole",one,
t1_gslgtg7,"$FEG; Developers are building a cross chain exchange. Meaning they are taking pancake swap and uniswap but combining them together, being able to buy or swap coins from the BSC network and ERC network. Since the code is seamless &amp; Private! Gas fees will be really reduced and user interaction would be seamless as the exchange will set the correct slippage % automatically which makes a great user experience.

Now, ways to make passive income:

1 - You holding FEG in your wallet, you will automatically receive 1% of any transaction whether someone sells or buys feg, 1% is shared to the holders in ratio to how much they are holding. More you hold, more rewards

2 - Staking, you would be able to stake your FEG which is used for transaction validation that helps securing the network. You get rewarded 0.1% of all sell transactions in either ETH or BNB depending on what side you bought token (FYI FEG can be bought on the ERC side (Uniswap), and BSC Side (PancakeSwap).

3 - 1 Sided liquidity. Normally you would have to pair a token for liquidity, not here, you can have 1 sided liquidity. You will also be rewarded in ETH or BNB depending on what side your providing liquidity in. At the moment, the % of how much you will receive in ETH or BNB has not been finalised and will be announced once it has in our future AMA's.

Investors are in here for the long run, compounding their rewards over time and wish to find financial freedom from passive income. With THREE ways of making passive income, losing just 2 zeros (x100) in the next 2-3 months is easily possible and thats a super conservative estimate. Just don't expect this to hit $1 in the next 10 years. But getting to $0.0001 (x1,000,000) in 10 years could be possible with token burning in sustained high volume (very ambitious though).

We are all waiting for FegEx (the exchange to come out). When that comes out you can do your staking and one sided liquidity. There will be videos and FAQ guides on how to do these once FegEx is out which will be in the next 3 days.

Our community has a 24/7 live call going in our telegram group for anyone who has questions, speculations, curiosity. I kept my FEG due to the community helping me understand the project motivating me to buy more. [https://t.me/FEGchat](https://t.me/FEGchat)

So far, all you see about FEG on Social Media other than the FEGToken Twitter page has been organic. Meaning the only marketing you see about FEG is done by the community. This is so that we didn't attract whales for a pump and dump. And most whales we have had have come and gone, and our community has bought up the dip not allowing the whales to manipulate.",one,
t1_gsnen4a,"XGG — has utility, gambling.  Of course when I read moonshots, and this was three days old when I read it today I usually go and check the activity and generally a coin has gone 100x or more and I know it’s futile to dive in now.  But when I checked this one today, ~4hrs ago, it was only 4x since inception.  I actually didn’t miss out on something decent, not just a gimmicky coin.  So reading up on it, the op has has a point, gambling is a gold mine.  And the price is really manageable to get a small bag for cheap, $0.018 at the time.  Even though it’s via Uniswap, and I hate gas fees and have passed on so many moonshot postings because of fees, I said I wasn’t going to miss this one.  So I paid ~$50 in gas for a small bag.  And 4 hrs later it’s already at $0.0249.  It’s going to be a banger and even now at 6x from inception, it’s still quite early for anyone who also thinks it’ll pump.  https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/md658p/xgg_10x_gg_25_million_market_cap_gem_crypto/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",one,

t3_mf10am,"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",one,
t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

I hope you guys find this useful - I believe I'm the first one letting you all know about this project! I am new to crypto and even though there are hundreds of scams and shitposts and shitcoins in those reddit subs I still want to thank you all for contributing the occasional gems.

t3_mewyzy,Is it Safe for me to Verify my Coinbase Account with my ID?,one,
t3_mewyzy,"I want to verify my Coinbase account so that I can buy and sell some Bitcoin and Ethereum and sell some Dai. I am quite Skeptical about using my ID Card to verify that I can in control of my account as it contains quite some private information.
Does anyone know anything about how Cryptocurrency Exchanges like Coinbase Pro, Binance and Gemini use this data or how they store or auto verify it? I need someone to reassure me of what happens with my data. Or should I use another exchange like Kraken Pro? I am not sure which one is the best for trading and HODLing.

t3_mfi5gu,Amplify your DOGEcoin value effortlessly NOW!,one,
t3_mfi5gu," Many **Dogecoin HODLers** are looking forward for DOGE to hit $1. Given the current value at the time of writing, it is $0.0537 and hitting $1 means close to 19x. This also means if you had invested $100k in DOGE now, you will getting $1,900.00 when it moonshot to $1.

Impressive right?

What if there is a much better way to amplify more than 19x for a traditional DOGE, BTC, LTC algorithm lover? Your answer is none other than **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin!**

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

t3_mf1tfs,32 Reasons To Look Into Smartlands (SLT),one,
t3_mf1tfs,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

&amp;#x200B;

If you have the time, here is the AMA that took place in the ""RedRoomTG"" telegram yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So Badchar. The project is pretty complicated yet simple. So lets bite into it in pieces.

What is Badchar, could you start explaining for non-coders where the name is from :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Of course, ""Badchar"" stands for bad character. Bad characters are inhibitors inside shellcodes that don't allow them to run smoothly. Usually, bad characters are found and taken out of scripts that are used in a buffer overflow attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What inspired the project to become what it is. I don't think there is something similar out there

&amp;#x200B;

A: Badchar is a cryptography-focused bsc project. The project challenges users by allowing them to compete in a capture the flag style game where they are rewarded with NFTs and a small amount of bep20 tokens dependent on the difficulty of said challenge. The project's inspiration came from a well-known cryptography challenge group known as ""Cicada 3301"". I was very intrigued by the challenges back in the day and thought that it could be implemented inside this space.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: For people who know Cicada, knows what they can expect from Badchar. But for those who don't know about this - Can you give an example of a ''Challenge'' - Without revealing to much that makes people go on a hunt :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:So, let's say that I have a .txt file and inside this txt file is something that looks like this: flag{this\_is\_a\_flag) . Once users find this document and there is a flag inside, users can then submit the flag to a submission area for points. In this case, it's for crypto rewards. The means to get to this flag vary in difficulty using many different types of cryptography and data obfuscation. Basically the flag is hiding and you need to find it using unorthodox practice :)

&amp;#x200B;

Q:You said the rewards can be in NFTs. Can you showcase one or two of them. (I Am a fan of the designs) but other might have a look to :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Certainly. [https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa](https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa) Here is a look at one of our less rare NFTs that will be used in the capture the flag challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Lets talk about rarity. So lets say one of the NFTs are super rare - How many pieces are we talking?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Right, so rarity is based upon the difficulty of the challenge. Each NFT in the challenge space is one of a kind, the circles at the bottom of the NFT indicate rarity. Think of it as a trading card system. 1 circle is common and 5 is ultra rare. This will indicate value for each NFT. This, however only goes for the challenge NFTs as market NFTs can be up to five of a kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Can people be rewarded in other things than Nfts? you mentioned tokens

&amp;#x200B;

badchar dev, \[28.03.21 18:59\]

A: Correct. The user will be rewarded with a small amount of tokens based on difficulty as well as receiving that challenges respective NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:When will the game begin? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:Great question :) We have a set of 3 challenges being released right after this AMA ends. These challenges are just for fun and will not be rewarding any tokens or NFTs yet. Think of it as a community driven test run to gauge response and how well users preform under the current difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Okay :) Btw. I understand the Audit from Dessert is done - Can you share for people in here to dive into it :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: We encourage everyone to look through this at their hearts content. Dessert Finance did a phenomenal job!

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Cool, so... Lets go to the second part of Badchar. VOID - What is it? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:The VOID is badchar's third party staking platform for long term holders to compound their gains. Details regarding the VOID will be releasing at a later time as it is currently in development :)

&amp;#x200B;

A (cont.):Badchar is in this for the long haul. As you know gorilla, I've been working on this for quite some time and over that time I've been able to work on quite a bit. We have much more NFT challenges coming, An entire RPG game that will incorporate the NFTs, Future partnerships in the works, and Future marketing in the works as well. just think of a video game version of the previous command line style NFT challenges. The RPG game will be able to use the NFTs as ability upgrades, NFT specific playable characters, and hints. This is why the NFTs will become vital to the future RPG game :)

t3_mexmjm,"Hi all.
Wanted to take the opportunity to shine a light on two very low sat coins (around 60-70 sats each) everybody knows and have performed recently but haven’t mooned yet and have that “to 1 dollar!!” hype still ahead of them. One being FUN, the other REEF. 

REEF, currently trading at 67-68 sats has been subjected to a lot of fud generated primarily by FTX exchange that attempted to screw them over a REEF token buy agreement. Their code has just been released on GITHUB now: https://github.com/reef-defi  On the 31st of March they are launching their testnet. Currently in accumulation mode. Should continue to move up more the coming days.

FUN, trading in the high 60's the (literally) casino coin is also a legit coin attempting to be the goto coin for all casino related gambling/gaming. I noticed yesterday that there has been bot buying every minute, several buys of 2K’ish pass by. ‘Ve seen the same thing happen before their last spike, so that got me intrigued and I’m curious to see how it continues to perform.

t3_mfduoq,"An overview of Terra (LUNA), the DeFi ecosystem that exploded in 2021.",one,
t3_mfduoq,"
R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

____

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

___ 


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

Okay, I don't really need to say much here. Whether you're a hater or a lover of the recent events I think we all can agree that the money is going to keep *flowing* and that is why im here to give you all my analysis on why I think **$SafeX** is going to be the next **BIG** coin. ***80% liquidity locked to PancakeSwap for 5 years &amp; devs burned ALL team tokens!***

Let me start by saying first, I have hit big and I have lost on many coins here, many being early, many being late. This is all for fun for me and I have had a blast doing it. This is never **EVER** financial advice and you ALWAYS should **DYOR**. That means checking scan websites for addresses, rug pulls, developers, community, ECT. The chart shows very healthy growth. The bscscan is what truly speaks for itself on this one though bois.

A fork with COMMITTED, TRUE developers, $SafeX is a community driven project made for all the SpaceX lovers. SafeX employs 3 great functions : Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn In each trade, each transaction is taxed and fee is redistributed to all existing holders. With under 1,000 holders and a community that has steel legs &amp; diamonds for hands. I see this rising along with $ElonGate, $SafeMoon &amp; the other greats we've had this year.

Again, always **DYOR** but after what seemed like space-junk all over my feed, this has brought some light to the cockpit.

t3_mewzd6,My thoughts on MILK token so far,one,
t3_mewzd6,"Milk Token is blowing me away

I am not a financial advisor so do your own research. But this token has the most potential I’ve seen from a brand new coin. Its a meme but I wouldn’t say its a shit coin as it has real purpose. As of today the devs have donated over $4000 to charity and its only been up less than 4 days.

It reached 1400 holders recently.

It got a lot of traction quickly and clearly the devs were not expecting such a high influx so quickly. So there were some hiccups at launch, but the devs on this project have been amazing and transparent.

It has been listed on Blockfolio. Plus Coingecko and Coinmarketcap submissions are in.

There is currently a dip which is perfect for buying in early right now. They are launching a companion token called butter that works symbiotically with milk to make charity funds accrue automatically. When this launches this week I think it could moon! 100x growth potential and it looks like all of the whales just in it for pump and dump seem to be out now.

Butter token is coming out because originally milk transaction fees were meant to be sent to a charity wallet. 
Due to an error in the code, its not working. So the dev took the fees generated by the presale and donated it to charity already. 

You can find the proof here: https://imgur.com/gallery/pWTeHcf

Plus another donation today to a charity voted on by the community: https://imgur.com/a/uNeueMU

They seem to be working overtime answering every question the community has and its improved so much in just a short few days. 

On the website you can also find Twitter,Telegram,Discord,Github and subreddit

I think this hidden gem is really in for the long haul and could break the mold on how meme coins work, potentially becoming a major part of how charities start accepting crypto.

Once again I am no investor so do your own research. This is just a project thats been super positive so far and one I think will grow majorly!",one,
t3_mf1iqz,If you're all so smart how come Nobody here predicted Alice?,one,
t3_mf1iqz,I see so many shit coins being pumped but the one time when getting in early would have paid off huge I didn't see anyone predict it. What gives?,one,
t3_mfaknr,"$DSRT (DessertSwap) - New BSC foodcoin that audits farms, garbage coins, and rugpulls on BSC 200k marketcap easy 100x",one,
t3_mfaknr," 

They have less than 400 members in their telegram and have been around less than a month. The project has seen steady growth and I've seen it posted here a few times. I finally grabbed a bag. They seem to already have a business plan to make money which is through audits so they don't care about pumping the price of their coin or shilling which may be why there has been a steady price incline for a bit. Website and their first audit look well done. They already have 3 audits done and releasing another one later today and it looks pretty promising.

Do your own research but it's looking like a solid investment. Price action has not pumped yet and it has been a steady incline from 5 to 50 cents and now there's a pullback to 10. Looking like Good entry.

There are only a bit over 1 million in circulation so this will likely hit a dollar with no effort once the people find out and start pouring in. They are on pancakeswap but do your own research before you put anything in, obviously it would be very ironic if the one coin promising to fight against rugs ended up being a rug.

t3_mf8ne5,Before you Scroll- Hear out $GiveBack,one,
t3_mf8ne5,"Before you scroll down! - Hear me out on this new project called $GiveBack found on r/givebacktoken

**$GiveBack token (not just another DeFi scam) is striving to create a fully decentralized token with a community chosen charity tax on transactions

Although there are many stupid tokens out there already, none are currently operating with the charity aspect that’s community chosen.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain environment, $GiveBack token aims to make a difference in the world through crypto currency and community chosen charity. 

Holders and community members will have the ability to vote for the charity project each month to encourage involvement and make sure the money is going to the right place.

All and all, the aim is to integrate all of the blockchain protocol into a donation aspect so that people that don’t use crypto can at least get behind it for it’s donation use case, which will make promoting and finding buyers and users for the coin a lot easier.

**ROADMAP:**

*MARCH:*

\* Official launch! (30/03)  (Pancake Swap!)

\* Already has an active &amp; fun community on Discord and Telegram that is growing

*APRIL:*

\* Aiming for first exchange listings to start in April!

\* Partnerships

\* Official Audits should be completed by this point.

*MAY:*


\* Exchange listings

\* On top of this there is always on going development, the dev is very active in the community &amp; keen to keep everyone updated.

**TOKENOMICS:**

Total Supply: 10T

Total Circulating Supply: 4T

—To ensure the success of the project long term a small portion of each transaction goes into a community pool and charity wallet

-6% will automatically get added into the locked liquidity pool

-3%will be automatically redistributed to incentivize people to hold Memes Tokens.

-1% will be donated to a community chosen charity wallet

Contrary to all of the crazy “Safe” tokens that really aren’t that safe there is no burn as $GiveBack tokens strives to build an actually usable token ecosystem and want to avoid reduction in liquidity and artificial increase of the
value. 

Website: [https://givebacktoken.com/](https://givebacktoken.com/)

Reddit: r/GiveBackToken

With it not having even launched yet and the launch in a little over 2 days around 700 you could be one of the first buyers of a coin with amazing potential.

If people are not smart enough to learn from the hordes of posts on every turn of media in existence about avoiding scams, they have earned a very expensive lesson. Without this wild west type of place we have in crypto, the days of overnight 100x opportunities will be gone forever. The risk, as high as it may be, is absolutely equaled by the potential rewards.

t1_gsmczek,"# FOX FINANCE IS IT.  

I'm new to trading alt coins and this entire world of community based Tokens, but Fox had me engaged since Day 1. The Devs are always communicating, the community is great and is already making real world impact, and the tokenomics behind the coin are pretty valid. There is locked Liquidity so this isn't a rug pull. The Devs have already started the process for becoming a legal entity, and without a doubt we should be on CMC/CG sometime this week.  


The Devs host daily competitions in the Telegram where you have a chance to win some coin and they engage the community in real life challenges for rewards as well, I actually just won one while writing this post haha.  


So far we've had two community engagement events, the first was to plant a tree, those who provided evidence would be rewarded with token, the current one is to use a metal straw for your next drink and post an image with written evidence. These are small, cute ways that the Devs engage with it's community and incentives it to make positive change in the world. A lot is planned for the future, including Charities, and a member of the community even adopted a Fox!   


Now I know a lot of you are like this is cool great, but what about the $ and I feel you. This coin has personally made me over $3000 dollars. I say that not to boast, but I know a lot of people will want to know if there is money to be made and there absolutely is. Now is the perfect time to buy, we are in a dip after just reaching an ATH, like I said earlier we are soon to be listed on CMC and CG, and when that hits we are going to blast market this thing. The momentum will 100% be on our side and hopefully yours as well!   


I have super high hopes for this coin, and trust me I wouldn't take time out of my day to write all this if I didn't truly believe in the project and wanted more people on board.

Every swap has a 12% tax that feeds into an uncapped inflation mechanism. 

If that’s not bad enough (even Doge isn’t this bad), al it would take is a few rogue bot accounts to trigger and sustain hyperinflation and because its crypto, nothing can stop that. And if it can be stopped, it destroys the censor-proof nature of crypto and trust in the Binance smart chain.

Looking at the big picture, I could be wrong, but I believe HOGE was the first to have this kind of tax/automatic redistribution model (without staking required). I think within a year, one or two of these types of tokens will rise to the top as a new model of crypto investment. I've got bags in a few different tokens, so I hope one or all of them continue to rise and stay relevant in that time.

After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves   
So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. 

Using the cryptographically unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

# Okay cool but this is why I actually like this one:

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:**   


&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*   
Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee. 

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

t3_mf2ma4,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Second Chance for BNB!,btc,
t3_mf2ma4,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

Also, XVG recognized and promoted Mandala: [https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734)

Features of Mandala Exchange:

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU
* CCXT, CMC, and gecko within weeks
* Fiat onramp soon
* Native Token MDX - trading fee discounts and future utility
* Will list additional tokens not found on Binance starting very soon
* No need to KYC under 2 BTC per day and also
* Mandala phone apps
* Referral link for 10% of trading fees

You can buy MDX, directly here: [https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX\_USDT](https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX_USDT)

t1_gsmd3si,"Anytime someone is new on crypto I tell them to stick with Coinbase pro and big exchanges like that. When they are ready they can go onto binance, then kucoin. Thennnn when they are confident they can look into uniswap/not/pancake swap at their own risk 

I explain the bigger the exchange the less the risk but the less the return, but to be patient and not greedy and research! It took me a year to even dabble in most alt coins back in the day. And only this year I’ve started on UNIswap and all that jazz and I’ve been doing crypto since 2014/15 

I mean if a newbie is on this subreddit than good luck to them. I’ve already had a friend who started with crypto come to me crying because they bought in some shit coin meme thing because they got caught up in the hype and they had no exit plan or any idea what there were doing. They went straight to BTC to buying ETH and buying some rando coin through UNI swap and didn’t even know what a gas fee was 

Shyte coins are huge gambles but they are pretty easy to spot on here. Most of the time once they hit reddit it’s too late anyway. You have to find them within minutes on 4 chan or telegram and be selling within an hour or two. It seems once they get on reddit 90% of them are trying to shill because they are about to pull as soon as you buy or they already have pulled 

Read the comments. look how old accounts are. Read the charts. It will settle down soon. People are going wild. Remember how many alt coins there were in 2017??? It was insane. Every hour a new one. Same thing. Buy in early. I lost and made so much stupid money back then. Of course lost it all. It just took one bad buy in from a scam coin. Lol.

Seriously at this point I’m going to make a NFT of my own of my blind cat. I have the best image of his face with a trippy color wall behind him. If anyone is keen enough to buy my blind cat then good for them. He will give you absolutely nothing he is an asshole",btc,
t3_mfi5gu,Amplify your DOGEcoin value effortlessly NOW!,btc,
t3_mfi5gu," Many **Dogecoin HODLers** are looking forward for DOGE to hit $1. Given the current value at the time of writing, it is $0.0537 and hitting $1 means close to 19x. This also means if you had invested $100k in DOGE now, you will getting $1,900.00 when it moonshot to $1.

Impressive right?

What if there is a much better way to amplify more than 19x for a traditional DOGE, BTC, LTC algorithm lover? Your answer is none other than **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin!**

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

t1_gsmd3si,"Anytime someone is new on crypto I tell them to stick with Coinbase pro and big exchanges like that. When they are ready they can go onto binance, then kucoin. Thennnn when they are confident they can look into uniswap/not/pancake swap at their own risk 

I explain the bigger the exchange the less the risk but the less the return, but to be patient and not greedy and research! It took me a year to even dabble in most alt coins back in the day. And only this year I’ve started on UNIswap and all that jazz and I’ve been doing crypto since 2014/15 

I mean if a newbie is on this subreddit than good luck to them. I’ve already had a friend who started with crypto come to me crying because they bought in some shit coin meme thing because they got caught up in the hype and they had no exit plan or any idea what there were doing. They went straight to BTC to buying ETH and buying some rando coin through UNI swap and didn’t even know what a gas fee was 

Shyte coins are huge gambles but they are pretty easy to spot on here. Most of the time once they hit reddit it’s too late anyway. You have to find them within minutes on 4 chan or telegram and be selling within an hour or two. It seems once they get on reddit 90% of them are trying to shill because they are about to pull as soon as you buy or they already have pulled 

Read the comments. look how old accounts are. Read the charts. It will settle down soon. People are going wild. Remember how many alt coins there were in 2017??? It was insane. Every hour a new one. Same thing. Buy in early. I lost and made so much stupid money back then. Of course lost it all. It just took one bad buy in from a scam coin. Lol.

Seriously at this point I’m going to make a NFT of my own of my blind cat. I have the best image of his face with a trippy color wall behind him. If anyone is keen enough to buy my blind cat then good for them. He will give you absolutely nothing he is an asshole",eth,
t1_gslgtg7,"$FEG; Developers are building a cross chain exchange. Meaning they are taking pancake swap and uniswap but combining them together, being able to buy or swap coins from the BSC network and ERC network. Since the code is seamless &amp; Private! Gas fees will be really reduced and user interaction would be seamless as the exchange will set the correct slippage % automatically which makes a great user experience.

Now, ways to make passive income:

1 - You holding FEG in your wallet, you will automatically receive 1% of any transaction whether someone sells or buys feg, 1% is shared to the holders in ratio to how much they are holding. More you hold, more rewards

2 - Staking, you would be able to stake your FEG which is used for transaction validation that helps securing the network. You get rewarded 0.1% of all sell transactions in either ETH or BNB depending on what side you bought token (FYI FEG can be bought on the ERC side (Uniswap), and BSC Side (PancakeSwap).

3 - 1 Sided liquidity. Normally you would have to pair a token for liquidity, not here, you can have 1 sided liquidity. You will also be rewarded in ETH or BNB depending on what side your providing liquidity in. At the moment, the % of how much you will receive in ETH or BNB has not been finalised and will be announced once it has in our future AMA's.

Investors are in here for the long run, compounding their rewards over time and wish to find financial freedom from passive income. With THREE ways of making passive income, losing just 2 zeros (x100) in the next 2-3 months is easily possible and thats a super conservative estimate. Just don't expect this to hit $1 in the next 10 years. But getting to $0.0001 (x1,000,000) in 10 years could be possible with token burning in sustained high volume (very ambitious though).

We are all waiting for FegEx (the exchange to come out). When that comes out you can do your staking and one sided liquidity. There will be videos and FAQ guides on how to do these once FegEx is out which will be in the next 3 days.

Our community has a 24/7 live call going in our telegram group for anyone who has questions, speculations, curiosity. I kept my FEG due to the community helping me understand the project motivating me to buy more. [https://t.me/FEGchat](https://t.me/FEGchat)

So far, all you see about FEG on Social Media other than the FEGToken Twitter page has been organic. Meaning the only marketing you see about FEG is done by the community. This is so that we didn't attract whales for a pump and dump. And most whales we have had have come and gone, and our community has bought up the dip not allowing the whales to manipulate.",eth,

t3_mfbwcc,"Sup y'all.  
After hours of stumbling through the jungle of what crypto has become in 2021 with all the memecoins, I've come back from the depths of uniswap and found a giant in the making. This solves   
So what is EBOX?

ETHBOX provides a unique solution to a problem in cryptocurrency trading that is as devastating as it is widespread[,](https://miro.medium.com/max/2998/1*VAjqowflCeKDQgHrBKeuzg.jpeg) Accidentally sending funds to a mistyped or mistaken recipient address has already been the cause for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of financial damage. 

Using the cryptographically unbreakable safety of the Ethereum blockchain, ethbox provides a smart-contract-based digital escrow service to completely alleviate any risk of loss while sending cryptocurrency.

# Okay cool but this is why I actually like this one:

Sending funds through ethbox disrupts the chain of transparently traceable blockchain transactions. This means you can do a great lot of things with it that mostly only benefit you, the user of ethbox.

What I like about it has to be the easy way to anonymously change wallets. This is a big deal for me as I am careful about being tracked on the ethereum blockchain, as that can fuck you up. 

**For me that process used to be:**   


&gt;Let’s go to **binance**! *(ugh... depositing money on a centralized market)*   
Exchange **to BTC,** change it **back to ETH** to get a new withdrawal address *(So the address that sends you the ETH will be a new one)* for me to then create a **new wallet** on Metamask and send it **through there. Tedious.**

And let us not forget about the plain privacy of just receiving money from someone on the internet and sending the ethbox address for you to then withdraw it from there. Your own personal escrow service.

For situations where discretion is required, users have the option of wrapping ethbox transactions with an additional layer of privacy, for a small increase in the service fee. 

**It's very easy to use:**

* Navigate to their UI
* Type the amount you wish to send, the recipient, and a passphrase;
* Sign the transaction to deposit funds.
* Give your recipient the passphrase.
* The recipient goes to the UI and gets the funds.

This is already damn cool, but there's another cool feature that is called **Over the Counter trading, and it's a p2p conditional exchange of tokens** in which one party setup the condition and the exchange take place once conditions are met.

There's also a **privacy feature which is being developed** at the moment which enables a **mixer** so that your funds come out clean and untraceable to the recipient side. It used to be a deep-web-only thing for a long time.

    Test it out: https://ethbox.org/testnet/

Token Utility

* **EBOX is a deflationary token -** guaranteed by buying back and burning part of the generated fee.
* **Staking -** generates passive income for EBOX holders for 4 years following token generation.
* **Regular payout** of profit share to EBOX token holders
* **Governance** gives voting rights for upcoming project-related decisions decisions and enables EBOX holders to actively participate in the development of ethbox.

All of this means that there will be a lot of demand for this token, and apart from profit takers, no real sell pressure.

t3_mez4bz,SwapDEX - The next 100x gem?,long,
t3_mez4bz,"Okay, before I start I will make it clear that I am not affiliated with the development, marketing or mod team of SwapDEX, I am simply a long time investor who is super bullish on what the future holds with SDX and with some of the gems I've received off this board I'd like to give one back.

# SwapDEX - features two trading platforms. The swap exchange and the decentralized exchange.

The exchange has 2 key features that get me excited. The first being its aggregator which in testing gave the best adjusted price (amount received after fees and gas) 72% of the time when compared to Uniswap, 1inch, Dex Ag and Paraswap. Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

If you are interested in reading about the Swap exchange or the DEX, feel free to click this link [here](https://swapdexoldaccount.medium.com/the-beginning-of-something-special-6dd2a84aa7c8). Generic to other exchanges, although this is a primary feature of the SwapDEX project, I feel it isn't nearly the most thing I am attracted to with this product.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

t3_mf9dy8,Mdex potential to reach the heights of pancakeswap/sushi swap?,long,
t3_mf9dy8,"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mdex/social/

This is the first time I’ve written a post on here I’m not shilling a shitcoin more wondering what people’s opinions are on MDEX. 

It’s a decentralised exchange similar to pancake swap and uniswap but on the heco chain, it was only launched in January but since then has passed uniswap in popularity and consistently has a higher trading volume. It’s total value locked is over 2 billion yet the market cap is 241 million so plenty of room to grow. 

Currently 76 million coins in circulation with a strong buy back and burn and reward system for incentivising long term holds. 

The trading figures and value locked in this exchange along with its low market cap are making me wonder if I’m missing something that is keeping the price low or if I’m right in thinking this coin could be genuinely set to take off similar to cake and sushi. 

Anyway take a look for yourselves and let me know what you think 🤙",long,
t1_gslgtg7,"$FEG; Developers are building a cross chain exchange. Meaning they are taking pancake swap and uniswap but combining them together, being able to buy or swap coins from the BSC network and ERC network. Since the code is seamless &amp; Private! Gas fees will be really reduced and user interaction would be seamless as the exchange will set the correct slippage % automatically which makes a great user experience.

Now, ways to make passive income:

1 - You holding FEG in your wallet, you will automatically receive 1% of any transaction whether someone sells or buys feg, 1% is shared to the holders in ratio to how much they are holding. More you hold, more rewards

2 - Staking, you would be able to stake your FEG which is used for transaction validation that helps securing the network. You get rewarded 0.1% of all sell transactions in either ETH or BNB depending on what side you bought token (FYI FEG can be bought on the ERC side (Uniswap), and BSC Side (PancakeSwap).

3 - 1 Sided liquidity. Normally you would have to pair a token for liquidity, not here, you can have 1 sided liquidity. You will also be rewarded in ETH or BNB depending on what side your providing liquidity in. At the moment, the % of how much you will receive in ETH or BNB has not been finalised and will be announced once it has in our future AMA's.

Investors are in here for the long run, compounding their rewards over time and wish to find financial freedom from passive income. With THREE ways of making passive income, losing just 2 zeros (x100) in the next 2-3 months is easily possible and thats a super conservative estimate. Just don't expect this to hit $1 in the next 10 years. But getting to $0.0001 (x1,000,000) in 10 years could be possible with token burning in sustained high volume (very ambitious though).

We are all waiting for FegEx (the exchange to come out). When that comes out you can do your staking and one sided liquidity. There will be videos and FAQ guides on how to do these once FegEx is out which will be in the next 3 days.

Our community has a 24/7 live call going in our telegram group for anyone who has questions, speculations, curiosity. I kept my FEG due to the community helping me understand the project motivating me to buy more. [https://t.me/FEGchat](https://t.me/FEGchat)

So far, all you see about FEG on Social Media other than the FEGToken Twitter page has been organic. Meaning the only marketing you see about FEG is done by the community. This is so that we didn't attract whales for a pump and dump. And most whales we have had have come and gone, and our community has bought up the dip not allowing the whales to manipulate.",long,
t3_mf1tfs,32 Reasons To Look Into Smartlands (SLT),long,
t3_mf1tfs,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

&amp;#x200B;

If you have the time, here is the AMA that took place in the ""RedRoomTG"" telegram yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So Badchar. The project is pretty complicated yet simple. So lets bite into it in pieces.

What is Badchar, could you start explaining for non-coders where the name is from :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Of course, ""Badchar"" stands for bad character. Bad characters are inhibitors inside shellcodes that don't allow them to run smoothly. Usually, bad characters are found and taken out of scripts that are used in a buffer overflow attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What inspired the project to become what it is. I don't think there is something similar out there

&amp;#x200B;

A: Badchar is a cryptography-focused bsc project. The project challenges users by allowing them to compete in a capture the flag style game where they are rewarded with NFTs and a small amount of bep20 tokens dependent on the difficulty of said challenge. The project's inspiration came from a well-known cryptography challenge group known as ""Cicada 3301"". I was very intrigued by the challenges back in the day and thought that it could be implemented inside this space.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: For people who know Cicada, knows what they can expect from Badchar. But for those who don't know about this - Can you give an example of a ''Challenge'' - Without revealing to much that makes people go on a hunt :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:So, let's say that I have a .txt file and inside this txt file is something that looks like this: flag{this\_is\_a\_flag) . Once users find this document and there is a flag inside, users can then submit the flag to a submission area for points. In this case, it's for crypto rewards. The means to get to this flag vary in difficulty using many different types of cryptography and data obfuscation. Basically the flag is hiding and you need to find it using unorthodox practice :)

&amp;#x200B;

Q:You said the rewards can be in NFTs. Can you showcase one or two of them. (I Am a fan of the designs) but other might have a look to :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Certainly. [https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa](https://imgur.com/a/GMDuDFa) Here is a look at one of our less rare NFTs that will be used in the capture the flag challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Lets talk about rarity. So lets say one of the NFTs are super rare - How many pieces are we talking?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Right, so rarity is based upon the difficulty of the challenge. Each NFT in the challenge space is one of a kind, the circles at the bottom of the NFT indicate rarity. Think of it as a trading card system. 1 circle is common and 5 is ultra rare. This will indicate value for each NFT. This, however only goes for the challenge NFTs as market NFTs can be up to five of a kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Can people be rewarded in other things than Nfts? you mentioned tokens

&amp;#x200B;

badchar dev, \[28.03.21 18:59\]

A: Correct. The user will be rewarded with a small amount of tokens based on difficulty as well as receiving that challenges respective NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:When will the game begin? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:Great question :) We have a set of 3 challenges being released right after this AMA ends. These challenges are just for fun and will not be rewarding any tokens or NFTs yet. Think of it as a community driven test run to gauge response and how well users preform under the current difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Okay :) Btw. I understand the Audit from Dessert is done - Can you share for people in here to dive into it :)

&amp;#x200B;

A: We encourage everyone to look through this at their hearts content. Dessert Finance did a phenomenal job!

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Cool, so... Lets go to the second part of Badchar. VOID - What is it? :)

&amp;#x200B;

A:The VOID is badchar's third party staking platform for long term holders to compound their gains. Details regarding the VOID will be releasing at a later time as it is currently in development :)

&amp;#x200B;

A (cont.):Badchar is in this for the long haul. As you know gorilla, I've been working on this for quite some time and over that time I've been able to work on quite a bit. We have much more NFT challenges coming, An entire RPG game that will incorporate the NFTs, Future partnerships in the works, and Future marketing in the works as well. just think of a video game version of the previous command line style NFT challenges. The RPG game will be able to use the NFTs as ability upgrades, NFT specific playable characters, and hints. This is why the NFTs will become vital to the future RPG game :)

t3_mfduoq,"An overview of Terra (LUNA), the DeFi ecosystem that exploded in 2021.",long,
t3_mfduoq,"
R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

____

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

t3_mewzd6,My thoughts on MILK token so far,long,
t3_mewzd6,"Milk Token is blowing me away

I am not a financial advisor so do your own research. But this token has the most potential I’ve seen from a brand new coin. Its a meme but I wouldn’t say its a shit coin as it has real purpose. As of today the devs have donated over $4000 to charity and its only been up less than 4 days.

It reached 1400 holders recently.

It got a lot of traction quickly and clearly the devs were not expecting such a high influx so quickly. So there were some hiccups at launch, but the devs on this project have been amazing and transparent.

It has been listed on Blockfolio. Plus Coingecko and Coinmarketcap submissions are in.

There is currently a dip which is perfect for buying in early right now. They are launching a companion token called butter that works symbiotically with milk to make charity funds accrue automatically. When this launches this week I think it could moon! 100x growth potential and it looks like all of the whales just in it for pump and dump seem to be out now.

Butter token is coming out because originally milk transaction fees were meant to be sent to a charity wallet. 
Due to an error in the code, its not working. So the dev took the fees generated by the presale and donated it to charity already. 

You can find the proof here: https://imgur.com/gallery/pWTeHcf

Plus another donation today to a charity voted on by the community: https://imgur.com/a/uNeueMU

They seem to be working overtime answering every question the community has and its improved so much in just a short few days. 

On the website you can also find Twitter,Telegram,Discord,Github and subreddit

https://milktoken.net/

Contract address: https://bscscan.com/address/0xb7CEF49d89321e22dd3F51a212d58398Ad542640
Pancakeswap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xb7CEF49d89321e22dd3F51a212d58398Ad542640

I think this hidden gem is really in for the long haul and could break the mold on how meme coins work, potentially becoming a major part of how charities start accepting crypto.

Once again I am no investor so do your own research. This is just a project thats been super positive so far and one I think will grow majorly!",long,
t3_mf8ne5,Before you Scroll- Hear out $GiveBack,long,
t3_mf8ne5,"Before you scroll down! - Hear me out on this new project called $GiveBack found on r/givebacktoken

**$GiveBack token (not just another DeFi scam) is striving to create a fully decentralized token with a community chosen charity tax on transactions

Although there are many stupid tokens out there already, none are currently operating with the charity aspect that’s community chosen.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain environment, $GiveBack token aims to make a difference in the world through crypto currency and community chosen charity. 

Holders and community members will have the ability to vote for the charity project each month to encourage involvement and make sure the money is going to the right place.

All and all, the aim is to integrate all of the blockchain protocol into a donation aspect so that people that don’t use crypto can at least get behind it for it’s donation use case, which will make promoting and finding buyers and users for the coin a lot easier.

**ROADMAP:**

*MARCH:*

\* Official launch! (30/03)  (Pancake Swap!)

\* Already has an active &amp; fun community on Discord and Telegram that is growing

*APRIL:*

\* Aiming for first exchange listings to start in April!

\* Partnerships

\* Official Audits should be completed by this point.

*MAY:*


\* Exchange listings

\* On top of this there is always on going development, the dev is very active in the community &amp; keen to keep everyone updated.

**TOKENOMICS:**

Total Supply: 10T

Total Circulating Supply: 4T

—To ensure the success of the project long term a small portion of each transaction goes into a community pool and charity wallet

-6% will automatically get added into the locked liquidity pool

-3%will be automatically redistributed to incentivize people to hold Memes Tokens.

-1% will be donated to a community chosen charity wallet

Contrary to all of the crazy “Safe” tokens that really aren’t that safe there is no burn as $GiveBack tokens strives to build an actually usable token ecosystem and want to avoid reduction in liquidity and artificial increase of the
value.

t1_gslr7qg,"In my humble opinion: 

ADA - good team, long term project with good visions, staking rewards of 5% (not locked in like DOT), low fees, 

XLM - quite stable price, fast and cheap transfers/payments, might become a big payment method one day, and a beautiful name.

DOT - great network with potential in future for many projects and Dapps, good team, staking rewards of 12% (locked in though)

ZIL - great ecosystem, still relatively cheap (although it has shot up quite a bit already), eco-friendly mining, smart contracts, and sharding. 

ETH - one of the top cryptos and always will be especially after they release 2.0 (fixing gas fees and other things) 

There are many more coins to discover for good long term potentials. 

As we are in a bull run now, buy minimal amounts weekly and do DCA. Wait for the inevitable drop and bear run and buy bigger amounts as it keeps dropping and then hodl and hopefully we will be able to retire in 10+ years.",long,

5. An NFT marketplace is coming built on GoChain

6. Trading volume has been increasing

7. They've been added to gate.io exchange

8. Oh and Ecomi (VEVE NFT project built on GoChain) has a market cap bigger than the native token. It's only a matter of time before Go catches up.

9. 100% ETH compatible, 1300 tps (upgradeable to 13,000 tps), 1000x cheaper, transactions in 5 seconds or less, and upgradeable Smart Contracts

10*. We may finally get word on Arabian Bourse/ABX (an asset custodian exchange built on GoChain)

I hope you guys are paying attention. It's been a sleeping giant for too long.

Look at this block. 100 transactions. All completed in under 5 seconds for less than 9 Go. At current prices, that puts it at less than 50 cents in total for everything you see here. Oh, and all the gas was burned!

Active dev and marketing leadership are reducing fast sells and investing in long term growth of a proven code by working with the community to generate involvement from the ground up.

The first order of business is to airdrop anyone using their hashtag on Twitter as long as they've shared their public address to receive it. Holders can accumulate 5 times a day and tokens are sent out each night. High quality tweets will get shared and receive bonus tokens as well.

There's a strong roadmap for the development of the network including NFTs and integration with other projects to be announced, as well as additional plans every week to keep sending more tokens to anyone active in the environment beyond what they already earn just from the tokenomics.

The basis of the token is built on ease of use. No staking, no farming, just unity and accumulation. As great as it is to have automated smart contracts, it completely eliminates the ability for people to get involved, which causes pumps and dumps. UNITi has no interest in being a standard, run of the mill shitcoin and everyone is working their asses off to prove it on social media, in their telegram and on their site.

It's a TINY microcap project (sitting at about $260k) with amazing potential just by continuing to engage with holders and keep excitement moving for the project. There's a huge future ahead built on transparency and safety. The first liquidity link was burnt and there's a transaction cap to stop the price from obliterating your investment. You can check out their contract on BSCscan to see the deploy wallet's transactions to holders. This token only launched a few DAYS ago and it's already hit $1 and is on the road to doing it again. Total supply is only 1,000,000 token decreasing RAPIDLY.

I'm skeptical of any token that burns 50% at the start, as nobody is actually benefiting from the supply shrinking. 

The add to the liquidity pool inflates the number of tokens in the pool, but keeping at the current price level. By keeping a large liquidity, the price is not as volatile and prone to pumps or dumps. Furthermore, the 12% tax on buy or sell discourages day trading.",long,

Devs have been active in Telegram and have announced and reiterated several times that they aim to burn 1T per day until 50% is burned, and they definitely have enough supply to get through a couple months of doing so, so I wonder what their plan is to keep that up.

As of right now there is only a telegram page, this project has super low exposure, this is my candidate for a moon shot because the holders remains at 200 with supply pretty evenly distributed, I think if the devs push out what they intend to do in a timely manor the price could appreciate pretty easily, what made me like the project is the fact that I’m a front end dev and I’ve never seen a site look the way theirs does it’s pretty awesome, I have some respect for their front end engineer so without further ado I’ll leave some more info down below

 this project is trying to achieve building a full on cyber punk crypto city, the first place the “bar” is located in uniswap district and serves as the starting point of the city while the devs work on building and integrating more interactive elements to the site one of the things in development is a casino/game room that uses L2 or BSC for seamless transaction speed and reduced fees. They have no competition from what I can find they are doing weird things! Right now you can stake the COC to farm Mojitos and possibly use those to mint special NFTs “editable limited edition characters are a possible outcome meaning you could walk around the crypto city as a unique individual and trade with other city dwellers! This project is super unique and the site showcases its potential as a low cap gem! ATH was around 30$ pretty good price entry right now hope to see you all at the bar! 🍹❤️

t3_mewzd6,My thoughts on MILK token so far,moon,
t3_mewzd6,"Milk Token is blowing me away

I am not a financial advisor so do your own research. But this token has the most potential I’ve seen from a brand new coin. Its a meme but I wouldn’t say its a shit coin as it has real purpose. As of today the devs have donated over $4000 to charity and its only been up less than 4 days.

It reached 1400 holders recently.

It got a lot of traction quickly and clearly the devs were not expecting such a high influx so quickly. So there were some hiccups at launch, but the devs on this project have been amazing and transparent.

It has been listed on Blockfolio. Plus Coingecko and Coinmarketcap submissions are in.

There is currently a dip which is perfect for buying in early right now. They are launching a companion token called butter that works symbiotically with milk to make charity funds accrue automatically. When this launches this week I think it could moon! 100x growth potential and it looks like all of the whales just in it for pump and dump seem to be out now.

Butter token is coming out because originally milk transaction fees were meant to be sent to a charity wallet. 
Due to an error in the code, its not working. So the dev took the fees generated by the presale and donated it to charity already. 

You can find the proof here: https://imgur.com/gallery/pWTeHcf

Plus another donation today to a charity voted on by the community: https://imgur.com/a/uNeueMU

They seem to be working overtime answering every question the community has and its improved so much in just a short few days. 

On the website you can also find Twitter,Telegram,Discord,Github and subreddit

I think this hidden gem is really in for the long haul and could break the mold on how meme coins work, potentially becoming a major part of how charities start accepting crypto.

t3_mf5rsf,Why i am so (pit-)bullish on memecoins and the $Pitbull Community?,moon,
t3_mf5rsf,"$PIT - The reason im (Pit)bullish on this community token

4 years ago we were in Altcoinheaven, everyday another low mcap coin flew straight to the moon.
This is year we might have Altcoin season again (if we are not in already) and memetokens are no doubt a big part of it. Wether you like it or not, they are pumping like crazy currently. There are tokens promising to bring you safe on the moon or the mars or animaltokens like hoge or chonk.
With all those Hundreds of memetokens many Investors got dumped on/rugpulled or had to sell at loss. Its all about Timing, research and trust. After i Made really good Profit with memecoins already, im conviced i found the next real moonshot in this ocean of memes. 

I present you $PIT (PitbullBSC): 

A Community driven BSC DeFi token with a growing holderbase (getting early HOGE-Vibes here).

50% Burned at the beginning / 2% burning of each transaction + 2% distrubution to every Holder.

Although at first Impression it seemed like another cheap knock-off with a crappy Website, my mind changed really fast after joining their Group. 

The original Dev Burned his LP and left the token for the Community to find it. A bunch of dedicated holders formed the new community around the coin. 

We encourage others to get active and join us in our journey. 

Anybody who wants to contribute is able to do so. 

And we always looking for new talented people all over the internet

In the last days, the community grew to over 4500 Holders, 2300 TG users, 120 subscriber on YouTube, 850 follower in twitter. You name it we got it. 

We paid for an professional audit https://twitter.com/TechRate1/status/1376094496203681795?s=09

We got approved to be listed on Whitebit and the community started to donate, which at the time of speaking is already over 5500$ from the 20k$ needed. 

An active members paid for a trust wallet listing and applied on their own behalf. 

We got listed on Blockfolio and are sitting on currently around 2.5M marketcap. 

With the new really awesome looking Website dropping in Monday + Coingecko, Coinmarketcap listing coming probably next week. 

The really good coin distribution (only 4 whales 🐳 holding about 1-2% rest is below 1%) makes the coin more safe from massive dump than the so called safecoins.

You can also look at our chart at https://poocoin.app/tokens/0xa57ac35ce91ee92caefaa8dc04140c8e232c2e50

And DYOR, our trading volume looks pretty nice and even big sells will recover fast. 

There are a lot of dedicated investors in our community and the got their stake in our coin!

**Location-based:** The  network focuses on location data. That means that we’re looking at  latitude, longitude, elevation, weather, temperature, and all the other  incredible things you can learn from a physical space! Right now, we’re  focusing on locations in a more map-based setting, but future  applications of our technology can combine all different attributes of  location.

**Decentralized:** This  essentially means “not centralized”. In our case, the XYO Network is a  network that relies on different devices that can exist all over the  world, but communicate through a common software.

Both MFI and MOD are risky imho, they are pre-launch, might not deliver, might be eaten by competition or might vanish altogether. It's crpyto and it's wild west of investing. It's like investing in low/no regulation startups. I am invested because they are not meme coins, sure they might fail, but at least they have interesting and usefull tech ideas and by my research a team to deliver, they don't overpromise and have huge upside potential. I would not throw lifesavings on it, but smaller bag might pay off. I know this is not your typical 10000x to the moon post. I just think it's fair to say that it is inherently risky.

t3_mf2ma4,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

t1_gsmj7fs,"Exchange coins typically do very well - BNB, 1inch, Sushiswap, Uniswap... very bullish on this. $1 is not out of the question for soon after launch.",bnb,
t1_gslgtg7,"$FEG; Developers are building a cross chain exchange. Meaning they are taking pancake swap and uniswap but combining them together, being able to buy or swap coins from the BSC network and ERC network. Since the code is seamless &amp; Private! Gas fees will be really reduced and user interaction would be seamless as the exchange will set the correct slippage % automatically which makes a great user experience.

Now, ways to make passive income:

1 - You holding FEG in your wallet, you will automatically receive 1% of any transaction whether someone sells or buys feg, 1% is shared to the holders in ratio to how much they are holding. More you hold, more rewards

2 - Staking, you would be able to stake your FEG which is used for transaction validation that helps securing the network. You get rewarded 0.1% of all sell transactions in either ETH or BNB depending on what side you bought token (FYI FEG can be bought on the ERC side (Uniswap), and BSC Side (PancakeSwap).

3 - 1 Sided liquidity. Normally you would have to pair a token for liquidity, not here, you can have 1 sided liquidity. You will also be rewarded in ETH or BNB depending on what side your providing liquidity in. At the moment, the % of how much you will receive in ETH or BNB has not been finalised and will be announced once it has in our future AMA's.

Investors are in here for the long run, compounding their rewards over time and wish to find financial freedom from passive income. With THREE ways of making passive income, losing just 2 zeros (x100) in the next 2-3 months is easily possible and thats a super conservative estimate. Just don't expect this to hit $1 in the next 10 years. But getting to $0.0001 (x1,000,000) in 10 years could be possible with token burning in sustained high volume (very ambitious though).

We are all waiting for FegEx (the exchange to come out). When that comes out you can do your staking and one sided liquidity. There will be videos and FAQ guides on how to do these once FegEx is out which will be in the next 3 days.

Our community has a 24/7 live call going in our telegram group for anyone who has questions, speculations, curiosity. I kept my FEG due to the community helping me understand the project motivating me to buy more. [https://t.me/FEGchat](https://t.me/FEGchat)

So far, all you see about FEG on Social Media other than the FEGToken Twitter page has been organic. Meaning the only marketing you see about FEG is done by the community. This is so that we didn't attract whales for a pump and dump. And most whales we have had have come and gone, and our community has bought up the dip not allowing the whales to manipulate.",bnb,
t3_mf10am,"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",bnb,
t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

I hope you guys find this useful - I believe I'm the first one letting you all know about this project! I am new to crypto and even though there are hundreds of scams and shitposts and shitcoins in those reddit subs I still want to thank you all for contributing the occasional gems. This is my way of giving back to the community here. Enjoy and let me know what you think of this coin in the comments!",bnb,
t3_mffpey,"The rare case to be made for $SafeX, a fair launch coin with 100% of team tokens already burnt",bnb,
t3_mffpey,"All Dev Tokens (roughly 30% of total supply) have already been burned and liquidity has been locked for 5 years via the DXsale. The devs had to buy in during the presale like everyone else, which had a small maximum contribution of 2 BNB. This is about as whale-proof and rugpull-proof as it gets. 

The presale sold out earlier today, but $SafeX has already had roughly $1 million in volume in a matter of hours since listing. The tokenomics are nothing new or special. Deflationary with burn and redistribution to holders but if you're looking for a truly fair meme coin, this is the one. As always DYOR.

t3_mfg9fi,"Excuse another post, but I wanted to have SSB see a detailed analysis-

Okay, I don't really need to say much here. Whether you're a hater or a lover of the recent events I think we all can agree that the money is going to keep *flowing* and that is why im here to give you all my analysis on why I think **$SafeX** is going to be the next **BIG** coin. ***80% liquidity locked to PancakeSwap for 5 years &amp; devs burned ALL team tokens!***

Let me start by saying first, I have hit big and I have lost on many coins here, many being early, many being late. This is all for fun for me and I have had a blast doing it. This is never **EVER** financial advice and you ALWAYS should **DYOR**. That means checking scan websites for addresses, rug pulls, developers, community, ECT. The chart shows very healthy growth. The bscscan is what truly speaks for itself on this one though bois.

A fork with COMMITTED, TRUE developers, $SafeX is a community driven project made for all the SpaceX lovers. SafeX employs 3 great functions : Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn In each trade, each transaction is taxed and fee is redistributed to all existing holders. With under 1,000 holders and a community that has steel legs &amp; diamonds for hands. I see this rising along with $ElonGate, $SafeMoon &amp; the other greats we've had this year.

Again, always **DYOR** but after what seemed like space-junk all over my feed, this has brought some light to the cockpit.

t3_mf1tfs,32 Reasons To Look Into Smartlands (SLT),bull,
t3_mf1tfs,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t1_gslr7qg,"In my humble opinion: 

ADA - good team, long term project with good visions, staking rewards of 5% (not locked in like DOT), low fees, 

XLM - quite stable price, fast and cheap transfers/payments, might become a big payment method one day, and a beautiful name.

DOT - great network with potential in future for many projects and Dapps, good team, staking rewards of 12% (locked in though)

ZIL - great ecosystem, still relatively cheap (although it has shot up quite a bit already), eco-friendly mining, smart contracts, and sharding. 

ETH - one of the top cryptos and always will be especially after they release 2.0 (fixing gas fees and other things) 

There are many more coins to discover for good long term potentials.

t3_mf1tfs,32 Reasons To Look Into Smartlands (SLT),bear,
t3_mf1tfs,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine.

Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..

This article was written by u/320prophecy and all credit goes to him.",bear,
t3_mfduoq,"An overview of Terra (LUNA), the DeFi ecosystem that exploded in 2021.",bear,
t3_mfduoq,"
R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

____

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

___ 


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

t1_gsl5x7t,"ONE - currently has significant advantages over ETH and ADA - check website and it has a nice comparative chart that shows advantages. 12% staking. Product is great and needs more marketing. Currently has advantages over ETH 2.0 and that’s years away. Has current advantages over future of ADA. Just hired a marketing director. Has gone up a bunch, but has a lot of room to grow market cap wise. Has a product that can withstand a bear market. 12% staking! and process to stake is simple. It’s the definition of a growth long term hold.",bear,
t1_gslr7qg,"In my humble opinion: 

ADA - good team, long term project with good visions, staking rewards of 5% (not locked in like DOT), low fees, 

XLM - quite stable price, fast and cheap transfers/payments, might become a big payment method one day, and a beautiful name.

DOT - great network with potential in future for many projects and Dapps, good team, staking rewards of 12% (locked in though)

ZIL - great ecosystem, still relatively cheap (although it has shot up quite a bit already), eco-friendly mining, smart contracts, and sharding. 

ETH - one of the top cryptos and always will be especially after they release 2.0 (fixing gas fees and other things) 

There are many more coins to discover for good long term potentials. 

As we are in a bull run now, buy minimal amounts weekly and do DCA. Wait for the inevitable drop and bear run and buy bigger amounts as it keeps dropping and then hodl and hopefully we will be able to retire in 10+ years.",bear,

t3_mf2ma4,🚀$MDX🚀 (Mandala Exchange Token) - Second Chance for BNB!,link,
t3_mf2ma4,"I want to represent MDX, the second chance for BNB!

MDX is a native token for Mandala Exchange, same with BNB with Binance. Mandala Exchange's wallets are the same as Binance, you can transfer your funds between Binance and Mandala without any fee, they are marked as ""Internal"". And as they have the same wallets, your funds are SAFU.

The good thing is, search MDX on Binance wallet and you can find this token: [https://ibb.co/6JHp69g](https://ibb.co/6JHp69g). So, I think that it is going to be listed on Binance soon because I think that Binance actually wants this project to succeed, as Mandala Exchange uses Binance's infrastructure.

MDX has the real use case, as you can see here: [https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken](https://www.mandala.exchange/mdxtoken). And as I asked one of the moderators, this list going to expand!

Although the maximum supply is 400M, 108M is locked and counting!

This is the etherscan token overview of MDX: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788](https://etherscan.io/token/0x947aeb02304391f8fbe5b25d7d98d649b57b1788#balances)

With this amount of circulation, 1 MDX = $0.14 USD. This is a bargain!

Also, XVG recognized and promoted Mandala: [https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734](https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/1375111619353673734)

Features of Mandala Exchange:

* Binance pairs and order books for equal liquidity
* Futures and Margins coming very soon
* All wallets insured by SAFU
* CCXT, CMC, and gecko within weeks
* Fiat onramp soon
* Native Token MDX - trading fee discounts and future utility
* Will list additional tokens not found on Binance starting very soon
* No need to KYC under 2 BTC per day and also
* Mandala phone apps
* Referral link for 10% of trading fees

You can buy MDX, directly here: [https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX\_USDT](https://trade.mandala.exchange/trade/MDX_USDT)

t3_mez4bz,SwapDEX - The next 100x gem?,link,
t3_mez4bz,"Okay, before I start I will make it clear that I am not affiliated with the development, marketing or mod team of SwapDEX, I am simply a long time investor who is super bullish on what the future holds with SDX and with some of the gems I've received off this board I'd like to give one back.

# SwapDEX - features two trading platforms. The swap exchange and the decentralized exchange.

The exchange has 2 key features that get me excited. The first being its aggregator which in testing gave the best adjusted price (amount received after fees and gas) 72% of the time when compared to Uniswap, 1inch, Dex Ag and Paraswap. Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

If you are interested in reading about the Swap exchange or the DEX, feel free to click this link [here](https://swapdexoldaccount.medium.com/the-beginning-of-something-special-6dd2a84aa7c8). Generic to other exchanges, although this is a primary feature of the SwapDEX project, I feel it isn't nearly the most thing I am attracted to with this product.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

t3_mf10am,"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",link,
t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

I hope you guys find this useful - I believe I'm the first one letting you all know about this project! I am new to crypto and even though there are hundreds of scams and shitposts and shitcoins in those reddit subs I still want to thank you all for contributing the occasional gems. This is my way of giving back to the community here. Enjoy and let me know what you think of this coin in the comments!",link,
t3_mf1tfs,32 Reasons To Look Into Smartlands (SLT),link,
t3_mf1tfs,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t3_mfduoq,"An overview of Terra (LUNA), the DeFi ecosystem that exploded in 2021.",link,
t3_mfduoq,"
R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

____

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK.

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

___ 


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

t3_mf4z6h,"$UNITiProtocol is a token based off some recently popular coins with a new take on rewarding members beyond simple reflection tokenomics. Active dev and marketing leadership are reducing fast sells and investing in long term growth of a proven code by working with the community to generate involvement from the ground up.

The first order of business is to airdrop anyone using their hashtag on Twitter as long as they've shared their public address to receive it. Holders can accumulate 5 times a day and tokens are sent out each night. High quality tweets will get shared and receive bonus tokens as well.

There's a strong roadmap for the development of the network including NFTs and integration with other projects to be announced, as well as additional plans every week to keep sending more tokens to anyone active in the environment beyond what they already earn just from the tokenomics.

The basis of the token is built on ease of use. No staking, no farming, just unity and accumulation. As great as it is to have automated smart contracts, it completely eliminates the ability for people to get involved, which causes pumps and dumps. UNITi has no interest in being a standard, run of the mill shitcoin and everyone is working their asses off to prove it on social media, in their telegram and on their site.

It's a TINY microcap project (sitting at about $260k) with amazing potential just by continuing to engage with holders and keep excitement moving for the project. There's a huge future ahead built on transparency and safety. The first liquidity link was burnt and there's a transaction cap to stop the price from obliterating your investment. You can check out their contract on BSCscan to see the deploy wallet's transactions to holders. This token only launched a few DAYS ago and it's already hit $1 and is on the road to doing it again. Total supply is only 1,000,000 token decreasing RAPIDLY.

t3_mez4bz,SwapDEX - The next 100x gem?,1inch,
t3_mez4bz,"Okay, before I start I will make it clear that I am not affiliated with the development, marketing or mod team of SwapDEX, I am simply a long time investor who is super bullish on what the future holds with SDX and with some of the gems I've received off this board I'd like to give one back.

# SwapDEX - features two trading platforms. The swap exchange and the decentralized exchange.

The exchange has 2 key features that get me excited. The first being its aggregator which in testing gave the best adjusted price (amount received after fees and gas) 72% of the time when compared to Uniswap, 1inch, Dex Ag and Paraswap. Most people don't shop around between exchanges, so going with the exchange that gives the best price 72% of the time seems like a no-brainier.

If you are interested in reading about the Swap exchange or the DEX, feel free to click this link [here](https://swapdexoldaccount.medium.com/the-beginning-of-something-special-6dd2a84aa7c8). Generic to other exchanges, although this is a primary feature of the SwapDEX project, I feel it isn't nearly the most thing I am attracted to with this product.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago SwapDEX dev team had promised to release the SwapDEX trading platform, but with Eth gas fees around $50 per transaction the release wouldn't have been feasible for future users OR the longterm success of the platform. The SwapDEX Smart Chain is within a &gt;!!!couple of weeks!!\~!&lt; of being fully operational and released.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

Gas is currently a major issue on the Ethereum blockchain so accelerating the efforts of the devs to move the platform onto its **own chain**. They previously planned to move onto their own SDX chain after launch, but now plan to be on our own chain **at launch**. This will make gas issues a thing of the past.

* Moving the platform to SwapDEX **own chain** where the native SwapDEX token (SDX) will be used for gas resulting in substantial savings in transaction fees and the ability to trade across chains. This chain will operate on a Proof of Stake model where holders of SDX will have the opportunity to contribute to become a node for the chain. [Read into the lowdown of nodes for SwapDEX Smart Chain.](https://medium.com/@SwapDEX/the-lowdown-on-nodes-94e76baab31c)
* **Aggregator** added to the Swap exchange. The [aggregator](https://swapdex.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SWAPDEX.pdf#page=10) will pool liquidity across a number of different exchanges in order to give you the cheapest rate when purchasing coins. During testing, when operating on the Ethereum network, SwapDEX provided the cheapest price after fees 7/10 times. This number will increase furthermore when we are operating on our own chain with a substantial reduction in transaction fees.
* Launch of the platform’s **Stablecoin** which will be soft-pegged to the US dollar.
* **Lending** platform to allow users to put their tokens up as collateral for loans for a small interest fee. This means you will not need to sell your tokens just to buy into another project.
* **Staking** of the SDX token. All income from the platform, such as transaction fees from the exchanges or interest from loans, will go into a central fund where it will be converted to the Stablecoin and distributed to stakers of the SDX token on a pro-rata basis.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fund initiatives going forward, part of the gas spent on transactions on the SSC will go into the Community Fund. The funds held here will only be spent when voted on and approved by SDX holders. The beauty of this fund is it will be driven by and decided on by the community. To give a general idea, possible examples of initiatives that could be proposed and voted on include:

* New DApps, Apps or tools for the platform or the chain, such as an Android and iPhone app for the exchange.
* Partnerships and marketing initiatives with new projects launching on SSC.
* Additional dividend payments to SDX holders paid from the fund.

Essentially, SwapDEX Smart Chain is a truly decentralised Eth alternative to Binance Smart Chain. Looking at the MC's of the following; BSC- **$42,000,000,000\~** market cap / SSC -**$8,000,000\~** market cap. There is definitely something to look forward to with this project!

t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

Why not take a look at it from the perspective of hosting data specifically, especially with the advent of the BTFS (BitTorrent File system)? Have a movie collection that you want to archive? Drop the NAS and just have someone host it for you. 

A cloud service independent of AWS/Azure, paying people directly to keep data alive.

A file server with cold data, or backups? Screw AWS or the other cloud services, just encrypt it and toss it in a torrent and have the hive mind keep that baby alive. 

All that fast download stuff IMO is nonsense with very specific use cases for pirating and journalism/leaks, but hosting your data in an accessible manner, this is where I can see it potentially SAVING people money, though admittedly I don't know if that is the intention or even within the capability of the token.",btt,

t3_mfi5gu,Amplify your DOGEcoin value effortlessly NOW!,bitcoin,
t3_mfi5gu," Many **Dogecoin HODLers** are looking forward for DOGE to hit $1. Given the current value at the time of writing, it is $0.0537 and hitting $1 means close to 19x. This also means if you had invested $100k in DOGE now, you will getting $1,900.00 when it moonshot to $1.

Impressive right?

What if there is a much better way to amplify more than 19x for a traditional DOGE, BTC, LTC algorithm lover? Your answer is none other than **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin!**

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

t3_mfduoq,"
R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

____

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

___ 


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

DOT - great network with potential in future for many projects and Dapps, good team, staking rewards of 12% (locked in though)

ZIL - great ecosystem, still relatively cheap (although it has shot up quite a bit already), eco-friendly mining, smart contracts, and sharding. 

ETH - one of the top cryptos and always will be especially after they release 2.0 (fixing gas fees and other things) 

There are many more coins to discover for good long term potentials.

R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

&amp;nbsp;

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app.

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with).

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap.

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens.

- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat

These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with).

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.

R/cryptocurrency didn't seem to give a shit, perhaps one or two people here may find it interesting. 



For those who don't know, LUNA was trading at $0.5 back in december and $0.83 as late as the end of january. Since then it has gone on a meteoric rise, tapping $22, before pulling back and consolidating in the $18-19 range. Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK. 


Here is Do Kwon discussing the vision back in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGGalxADnbc

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with). 


&amp;nbsp;

___ 


&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

Anyone who spends enough time in the daily, will have likely seen me recommending LUNA or 'shilling' it for a long time. This post looks to introduce terra, LUNA and the associated dapps and why i believe it to be one of the most promising DEFI ecosystems or projects we have seen to date. 


LUNA began to get attention as it skyrocketed into the top 20 coins by marketcap. However it seems a lot of people are still not fully aware of what makes Terra stand out. I personally believe this is 'still early' (don't we all), and I hope this post can help people understand this project a little better.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background on Terra**


Terraform labs was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin back in 2018, and has received a great deal of capital funding from some extremely reputable backers. It is a blockchain which develops algorithmic stablecoins for payments. It is a DEFI protocol where all stablecoins (pegged to various currencies), are backed by the native token - LUNA. LUNA is used to stake to secure the network, for governance and as the collateral asset for these stablecoins (more on this below).


Here is a brief overview from coinbureau that sums up terra quite well: 

'By releasing fiat pegged stablecoins Terra is one part digital central bank. Another part of the system helps replace the current complicated and expensive payments chain that includes banks, payment gateways, and credit card networks. Terra is thus providing efficiencies for merchants and consumers, while continually improving on the infrastructure and tools of the ecosystem to eventually reach a transparent, distributed, credibly neutral payments system.

The project is already boasting mass adoption through its partner system CHAI, a South Korean payments gateway that already has over 2 million users. Using that as a springboard the team hopes to create a more widespread system by moving into other areas of Asia' 

&amp;nbsp;

So what makes Terra different to many other defi protocols is the fact they have focused outwards - beyond crypto, first, to build a market for their product before focusing inwardly and beginning to build the crypto side of things. By doing this there has been a large market established for UST (The terra dollar) by markets outside of crypto. As of today the UST has a $1.6bn marketcap and is the 5th largest stablecoin in issuance. The UST is used in various countries and has over 30 apps running on it already for various forms of e-commerce. And this is continuing to increase. Moreover, with the launch of Anchor protocol and Mirror protocol, the crypto demand is shooting up as well - i will touch upon these and other upcoming launches later on. 


I should add, briefly, TERRA is built on Cosmos SDK.

**LUNA - the native token**



Tokenomics:


This is where things get interesting as a LUNA holder. 
For every $1 of UST minted, $1 of LUNA must be burned. LUNA has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 and to date over 89 million have been burned already (there was a brief inflation of supply for the launch of anchor). Therefore as market demand for UST grows, LUNA will have an ever increasing supply squeeze in order to meet demand. And with over 30% of LUNA staked (and a 21 day unstaking period) there is a shortage already being seen on the market. Supply metrics (and much more) can be found here: https://terra.smartstake.io/


When demand for LUNA falls, and people sell - as happened on the recent correction, the demand for UST actually increases as well as many people swap luna back to UST, therefore a portion of LUNA is burned as well.


Stakers receive rewards from seigniorage in the native luna token and also from transaction rewards (paid in stablecoins), this amounts to around 10% APY per year, but is set to increase with columbus-5 which is being launched this month (this update also introduces the shuttle-bridge to make terra inter-operable with other blockchains, another thing we will come back to when we get onto Anchor protocol).  

&amp;nbsp;

Dem Airdrops:

In addition to this, LUNA stakers have so far benefited from two genesis airdrops of Anchor and Mirror as well as weekly airdrops of these coins. And there will be no stopping of airdrops any time soon.


- Anchor was airdropped to luna stakers earlier this month and will continue to be airdropped on a weekly basis for the next two years


- Mirror was airdropped back in january and will continue for another 40 weeks


Dapps we know about which are likely to have airdrops are as follows:

- SATURN - an on ramp service for fiat which allows people to transfer directly from their bank account into savings defi of up to 20% APY. https://saturnmoney.medium.com/introducing-tethys-democratized-liquidity-pool-powered-stablecoin-on-off-ramps-53c7981f8b30


- SPAR - a decentralised fund management app


- NEBULA - IYKYK


- DPH - shitcoin, bit pissed about this one 


- and a confirmed 10-12 others moving, including 3 automated market makers currently moving onto the blockchain 


- ALICE - unlikely to have a token but an app to bring all of terra together into one place. See this fairly simple to understand diagram: https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1372891254523039757/photo/1

**Anchor And Mirror - proof is in delivery**


So far Terra has launched two projects. The first was **Mirror**, this is a synthetics based app which allows you to buy synthetic assets and gives the option to pool them in a UST pool for a v.high APY. The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading. It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading in the future. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). 



Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Anchor Protocol** was launched this month, and with an admittedly shaky launch (a mad scramble for people to buy tokens), there was also an airdrop to stakers (as well as the weekly airdrops, as is fast becoming tradition).


Anchor is a Money market for borrowers and lenders, with the aim of offering a 20% fixed (or close to) APY on UST Deposits, with no lock up period, no minimum deposit or requirements to use, automatic compounding and small fees (0.5 UST). This is a savings protocol which unlike others does not rely on demand for any asset, but instead uses staking rewards from synthetic assets collateralised on the system to pay out block rewards to depositors. Now why would people deposit assets for loans?


Because you are paid to take out loans. If you mint bLUNA now and collateralise it to take out UST - you will be paid for doing so, currently to the tune of 180% APY, even if you do nothing with this money. This is paid out in ANC tokens. 


There are a million different strategies from here, for example:


- simply holding the UST in your wallet


- Buying more luna, collateralising it to increase your loan &gt; repeat 


- taking the ust and adding it to the ANC_UST pool and then using the rewards from the loan to pair it with ANC. Compounding with the weekly airdrops of ANC


These come with risks, and there is a safe loan amount, please do exercise caution - but the possibilities for this are endless. 


The ANC token itself is designed to grow super-linearly with increasing AUM locked into the protocol. And with a 20% stablecoin pay out, this may offer an attractive haven to people looking to save their profits (in addition to MIR). 



The Anchor protocol will soon be allowing loan deposits from ATOM, sETH and SOL holders - who will be able to earn 100%+ APY for borrowing against their asset. 



Where ANC begins to get really interesting is Do is looking to integrate fintech balance sheets onto the system currently which will be a game changer in terms of locked value (remember all UST demand burns luna), and integrating into the CHAI payments app. So essentially retail users will receive 20% interest on their money whilst it sits in an app - people from outside crypto will flock to this. The team at terra remains focused on real world adoption and believes what they are building will create an adopt or die mentality among business and fintechs within Korea (to begin with).

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**


LUNA is just getting started. What looks like a high market cap and price, is deceiving. With demand for UST growing every day through a dual process of real world adoption and crypto speculation, the LUNA token can continue a huge growth in the next year or so. 


There are 10-12 apps confirmed (and 50 applications for Terra in place), it has recently linked with LINK and has also launched the terrabridge to allow cross asset swapping.  


As a LUNA holder, what makes the ecosystem growth so rewarding is each action serves only to increase demand for UST and drive adoption of the system. The rewards as a staker can't be overstated and the apps launched to date have been incredibly strong from day 1. With minimal fees, decentralised governance, flexibility, extremely fast transactions and the ability to meet any investment strategy through the system - the use of terra will only increase. 

Disclosure, LUNA is my biggest holding and I will ride this shit into the ground - DYOR and have fun. Having said that, TeFi &gt; DeFi. IYKYK.

t3_mf7dgv,$SOJU Finance - Super High Earning From Yield Farming - Still Super Low Market Cap of $16k (Additional Information),etc,
t3_mf7dgv,"Hi, it's me again, I write this to add more useful information regarding the **SOJU** coin from my previous post.

If you are looking for a super cheap coin (not super low price with many digits, but the price considering market cap and circulating supply), you want to be safe enough, and you want to collect continuously the golden eggs from this golden chicken, then read this information below and also my previous post about the **SOJU** coin.

1. **SUPER HIGH RETURNS FROM YIELD FARMING:** Visit the website ([https://sojudefi.com/farms](https://sojudefi.com/farms)), you would see an incredible amount of **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**, which means the returns you get when you put for example **SOJU** and **SAKE** coin in **Liquidity Farm** would be super high (**APR 2800%**). To be clearer, putting $50 in this farm in this particular early period, each day you will get around $3 value of **SOJU**, each week will be $33 (compounding interest), hold until a month will be $400, and a year will be a lot more insane. And all of this happens only at the current very low price of **SOJU**, **imagine if you get the same amount of SOJU coins from Yield Farming but with a higher price of SOJU, which will be a lot more.**
2. **EASY TO FARM AND EASY TO USE:** You all may use Pancakeswap once, and it is really easy to use right? This **SOJU Farming** website also, because the outline and structure of it look really similar to Pancakeswap. But the only difference is that this golden chicken **SOJU** gives us a lot more returns from farming.
3. **SUPER CHEAP PRICE RIGHT NOW:** With the current market cap of $16k, I haven't seen any potential coins with this price before. You may know about SAFEMOON, SAFEMARS, HOGE, etc., and these coins have a market cap of at least $1million when you jumped in, and that's the lowest price. So, if you jump on this **SOJU** coin, there are no risky at all because the market cap is too small to be affected, and your balance could multiply more than 60x when the market cap of **SOJU** hits only $1million. (Invest only $10 is not risky, but it could be $600 in the future).

The coding of this project seems to be enough right now because it is the Yield Farming Project, so the activity of the devs team is not regular, and not based on any specific time frames. Please don't just base on their online activity to criticize this project.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is not financial advice, but if you can invest only $10 on this coin, it will yield a lot.

Even though defi is new, there's already *established players*.  Just use those and be happy.  Or wait until things have a large market cap.  A 2 billion market cap coin that's been around for like 3+ years probably isn't a pump and dump scheme or a scam.

Risk shouldn't be priced or regulated out of the market imo.  Is person x wants to pump all their investments into some 1 year old coin with $200k market cap and a $10k liquidity pool?  That's on them.  They have the right to do so.  People do skydiving, go bungie jumping, play russian roullete, etc.  Some people love the fear of losing everything.  

It's fair imo because nothing about anything forces you to live on the edge like this.  You could just be on sushi or compound farming well established stable coins and still making bank.

t3_mf10am,"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",busd,
t3_mf10am,"**TL;DR:**

It’s **a BSC fork of Curve finance** (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. Rewards are huge and currently makes you **5% per day** instantly claimable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis)

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)

**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.55, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link:

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f)

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY).

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months.

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.

**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum).

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!

**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.

**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

I hope you guys find this useful - I believe I'm the first one letting you all know about this project! I am new to crypto and even though there are hundreds of scams and shitposts and shitcoins in those reddit subs I still want to thank you all for contributing the occasional gems.

ADA - good team, long term project with good visions, staking rewards of 5% (not locked in like DOT), low fees,

DOT - great network with potential in future for many projects and Dapps, good team, staking rewards of 12% (locked in though)

ZIL - great ecosystem, still relatively cheap (although it has shot up quite a bit already), eco-friendly mining, smart contracts, and sharding. 

ETH - one of the top cryptos and always will be especially after they release 2.0 (fixing gas fees and other things)

Impressive right?

What if there is a much better way to amplify more than 19x for a traditional DOGE, BTC, LTC algorithm lover? Your answer is none other than **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin!**

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

Both NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin are paired with DOGE in Shorelinecrypto, trading at a price of 0.0000115 DOGE &amp; 0.000055 DOGE respectively. Converting to USD, it amounts to $0.00000061755 &amp; $0.0000029535. Now you may be saying. What's the big deal? It's so cheap and I doubt there is potential.

That is where the magic happens. Both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin** supports Android Mobile Decentralization that is very scalable globally. Which means one can download a full node wallet on their Android Mobile, getting it sync and mine at the same time. And that's not all. Android phone miners will have chance to get **Full Block Rewards (10,000 coins for both projects before next halving)** if they had successfully mine a block. Not those miserable shared mining rewards that is purely based on **Hashrate war** in mobile app mining pool.

The logic behind decentralization is very important in ALL crypto projects. It makes the network so secure that 51% attack is impossible. Hence, the more nodes we have, the more secure the network and project will be. Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum have about 12,000 nodes which is considered little due to many nodes having gone to pool mining just purely for profitability.

Now with **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**, you can maintain profitability with Android phone mining, while supporting the network on a global scale. That is a WIN-WIN situation since you will be getting a Full block reward. Imagine you are getting a Full Block of DOGEcoin using Android Phone mining. It's incredible.

Hence the scalability and the upside potential is massive and we know reaching even at $0.01 is very possible for both **NENGcoin &amp; Cheetahcoin**! That will be **1,000x, 10,000x or even more!**

**19x or 1,000x + you decide for yourself**

For peeps who had missed the bitcoin train, you should grab onto this huge opportunity! We know it can happen for sure 🚀🚀🚀

Scaling full nodes globally is not easy but we make it possible. Even Futurebit is looking for ways to improve more nodes on Bitcoin. Hence this direction and vision is on the path to moonshot!

This sub is actually one of the worst for enabling the scam projects as well, with each new day bringing a handful of projects named and/or styled after DOGE.

Every swap has a 12% tax that feeds into an uncapped inflation mechanism. 

If that’s not bad enough (even Doge isn’t this bad), al it would take is a few rogue bot accounts to trigger and sustain hyperinflation and because its crypto, nothing can stop that. And if it can be stopped, it destroys the censor-proof nature of crypto and trust in the Binance smart chain.

t3_mf9dy8,"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mdex/social/

This is the first time I’ve written a post on here I’m not shilling a shitcoin more wondering what people’s opinions are on MDEX. 

It’s a decentralised exchange similar to pancake swap and uniswap but on the heco chain, it was only launched in January but since then has passed uniswap in popularity and consistently has a higher trading volume. It’s total value locked is over 2 billion yet the market cap is 241 million so plenty of room to grow. 

Currently 76 million coins in circulation with a strong buy back and burn and reward system for incentivising long term holds. 

The trading figures and value locked in this exchange along with its low market cap are making me wonder if I’m missing something that is keeping the price low or if I’m right in thinking this coin could be genuinely set to take off similar to cake and sushi.

Even though defi is new, there's already *established players*.  Just use those and be happy.  Or wait until things have a large market cap.  A 2 billion market cap coin that's been around for like 3+ years probably isn't a pump and dump scheme or a scam.

Risk shouldn't be priced or regulated out of the market imo.  Is person x wants to pump all their investments into some 1 year old coin with $200k market cap and a $10k liquidity pool?  That's on them.  They have the right to do so.  People do skydiving, go bungie jumping, play russian roullete, etc.  Some people love the fear of losing everything.

I explain the bigger the exchange the less the risk but the less the return, but to be patient and not greedy and research! It took me a year to even dabble in most alt coins back in the day. And only this year I’ve started on UNIswap and all that jazz and I’ve been doing crypto since 2014/15 

I mean if a newbie is on this subreddit than good luck to them. I’ve already had a friend who started with crypto come to me crying because they bought in some shit coin meme thing because they got caught up in the hype and they had no exit plan or any idea what there were doing. They went straight to BTC to buying ETH and buying some rando coin through UNI swap and didn’t even know what a gas fee was 

Shyte coins are huge gambles but they are pretty easy to spot on here. Most of the time once they hit reddit it’s too late anyway. You have to find them within minutes on 4 chan or telegram and be selling within an hour or two. It seems once they get on reddit 90% of them are trying to shill because they are about to pull as soon as you buy or they already have pulled 

Read the comments. look how old accounts are. Read the charts. It will settle down soon. People are going wild. Remember how many alt coins there were in 2017??? It was insane. Every hour a new one. Same thing. Buy in early. I lost and made so much stupid money back then. Of course lost it all. It just took one bad buy in from a scam coin. Lol.
