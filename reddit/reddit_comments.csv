You\xe2\x80\x99d just prefer it to go up in between when you have call options written.  \n\nAll you need to remember is that options are a bet with a time frame. Start by thinking what YOU think will happen over x period of time, and then buy/write/combine whatever options you want just knowing that you\xe2\x80\x99re totally guessing. Know what your best case, worst case and in the middle case turnouts are.

That was the whole point of this sub lmao.\nHowever, every person should be responsible enough to actually *know* what they're getting themselves into. That's generally speaking, not *just* in trading options. We all know goddamn well that that's *never* been the fucking case, What. So. Ever. \n\nI'm gonna be completely blunt here so make what you will of it -as a retail trader that trades his own money, I feel personally threatened by the sheer amount of stupidity influx to market trading. Coming into the market, day in day out, you *know* the spread is top game and that the brokers are those who profit off everything, whether it's winning or losing you go through them. They know this shit inside out and in fact everyone who trades, imho, should have spent at least a couple of years working there. So yes, options are a way to hedge larger positions. They're risk management you need to do if you manage a lot of OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. That's what HeDGiEs do also. But a broker can do this to further profit off the outcome of the market on top of what they make already. They kinda really want/need you to lose too. And they SEE your bets and your assets. Even if they didn't, they could swing by here and see all your positions, apparently. They can literally choose if they want to remain delta or you're just an idiot and you're gonna lose so they won't have to buy anything. Go ahead, buy more way otm calls. They love that shit. Trading options with no intention of ever exercising them is a way to make a quick buck but also stupid and dangerous. Not saying it shouldn't be done. Just need to know what in the fuck you're doing. You can trade options from a mobile app, but you need to understand how options work. You need to understand your OS of choice, you need to understand how that particular app works. You have to *think* about that shit not just blindly deciding something means what you want it to mean.\n\nFor you see, to really understand the market you'd have to have been on every side of it. Managing large portfolios, knowing what risk actually means for banks, hedgefunds, everyone. Retail trading should kinda come last lol.

In other words, look for first-person pronouns like ""I"" or ""my"". If you\'re more familiar with NLP, you could dependency parse to eliminate first-person pronouns in cases like ""my wife\'s boyfriend"" where it\'s clear the commenter is not talking about their intentions, but someone else\'s.\n\nIt\'s totally possible that these media outlets have received data from some firm that\'s done analysis with these sorts of things in consideration. These aren\'t very complex NLP tactics, and any firm that analyzes anything on internet forums (a field that\'s been increasingly popular in the past few years) is likely to have taken these types of things into consideration.\n\ntl;dr - you need to find instances of people saying ""I will"" or ""my stimmy"" in order to filter out all the people saying things like ""people are gonna put their stimmy into GME"".

I'm not really a gamer(I used to be a little but I feel it is mainly a waste of time) but I see VR as potentially having major applications in many areas(mainly I am interested in educational aspects and I might, if GME were to moon, go in to developing some VR applications for education that I think would be very successful). Imagine GS leveraging VR with say tournaments. There used to be laser tag... imagine that with VR where the GS stores setup different virtual environments and run tournamets. Given how everyone wants to get back to normal, it could become a socializing thing. Who the hell knows. What matters is what RC does. If he does a few key things GME will most likely moon. He might spread them out, he might sell retail out(I doubt it but you never know, he might be forced to by the government or the HF's might put CP on his computer).\n\nI'm sure a lot of people bought stuff from GS during the pandemic such as the consoles and some games for their kids.

It\xe2\x80\x99s basically the other end of when you Buy a call. \n\nWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re selling a covered call, you\xe2\x80\x99re selling a contract that obligates your to sell all 100 shares of that contract for whatever price you set it to when you originally sell the contract. If the expiration date arrives (or the buyer decides to exercise) and your set price is \xe2\x80\x9cin the money\xe2\x80\x9d (under current strike price) then it will require you to complete the contract by selling your shares at the set price. \n\nYou make money in GME doing this by selling covered calls every week that expire that week, against the shares you own, and you sell them for a price you hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to so it expires \xe2\x80\x9cout of the money\xe2\x80\x9d.

1529,"b'So I understand it quite a bit more, but I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m still unsure how you turn this into serious cash. People say to sell calls for stocks that seem to keep going up like AAPL, but then I\xe2\x80\x99m almost betting against myself. AAPL is at $120 right now. It could easily be $127 within the week so I\xe2\x80\x99d want to sell my call higher than that\xe2\x80\xa6 but at $128 it\xe2\x80\x99s only 22\xc2\xa2 per contract, so I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at making $22 this week assuming it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hit $128? That\xe2\x80\x99s some pretty weak sauce, no? The comment above about making 20grand a month\xe2\x80\xa6 is that just suggesting that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got 10,000 shares so i sell 100 contracts and have to make $50 per contract per week? But that\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting I continually bet that AAPL won\xe2\x80\x99t hit $125? I mean I might be able to run that for like two weeks but pretty soon it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna hit $125 and then my shares are gone. I mean I guess I can then rebuy my shares\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m still missing how to make consistent money with this.\n\nAnd why does it have the ability to sell calls below current market price? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t someone just buy that as soon as the market opens and then I instantly sell my stocks for less than their worth?'",b't2_zr90s59',2021-03-20 20:09:49+00:00
1530,"b'Right, so selling covered calls on Apple is probably not a great idea.\n\nBut now, check out Gamestop. You could sell a $600 call expiring next week and make a few hundred dollars. And the thing too is that if GME does end up going above $600, you\'d still get paid $60k upon exercise since they\'re buying the shares from you at $600 per share. So even if the call does get exercised, you\'d still come out with a huge profit.\n\nETA: Regarding your question about calls below the current market price - keep in mind you are still paying a premium for the call. For example, you can buy a GME call expiring next week with a strike price of $195. Given the current stock price is $199, you\'re already ""in the money"" by $4. However, you have to pay $3,520 in order to get that option right now (this is called the option premium). So, if you bought the option now and exercised right away, you\'d make $400 (buy 100 shares at $195 and sell at $199) but since you spent $3,520 for the option you ended up losing a little over $3k. You would need the price to get to around $230 to break even on the call.'",b't2_67fakjbw',2021-03-20 22:35:53+00:00

The executive team has rushed to use the lifting of share price as an atm for quite some time now, but is no longer necessary to ensure the future of the company.  This short term infusion of capital not only harms per share valuation, but creates longer term problems for the company health.  Look at how $RYCEY diluted themselves into oblivion to the point that the only way they can ever raise capital again if through loans.  Or look how Viacom used Blockbuster as an atm machine to fund their purchase of Paramount for an example of how this ends up.  That's why Blockbuster doesn't exist anymore, not $NFLX or the artist formerly known as coinstar.  The only way this dilution makes sense if if they need the money to fund an acquisition (Dave and busters) or their plan is to drive the stock price down then initiate a share buyback program\n\nYes to executives because that's a formality.

Is the CCP really going to let a US company dominate their EV market? Not likely. More than likely Chinese companies will get the lions share with Tesla, Ford, GM and VW battling for the scraps.\n\nWe would also need interest rates to remain low for the next 10 years. Could that happen? Sure. But just as likely (market seems to be saying more than likely) is that the Fed induced inflation quickly becomes more than transitory and with their new reactive rather than proactive approach they will have to ratchet rates up quickly because they will be so far behind the curve. Tech valuations would suffer for many many years.\n\nThen we have to assume Ford, GM, and VW who all plan to move to fully electric in various capacities by 2030 completely crash and burn.

When the stock tanks to $40, your option will be worth $0 and expiring soon. Even a put might be worth less after the stock's drop than it is right now due to the need for the stock to move so much for breakeven and how IV crush tends to work (i.e. as the stock goes down, the IV will also go down so even selling your put may be harder as it may be worth less).""",b't2_pix2480',2021-03-20 20:09:35+00:00
2484,"b""You're still only thinking of weekly options. Other call options could actually be less risky than buying GME outright IMO. Here's a look:\n\nThe current stock price of GME is about $200. If you're going to buy 100 shares, that's $20k. Now GME drops to $40 and stays there, so you've lost 80% value- those stocks are now worth $4k total. You've lost $16k.\n\nNow let's say instead you're looking at GME options expiring in 2023 (two years from now). Right now, an ATM call option with that expiry on GME would cost roughly $12k. Let's say you buy the option and the price drops down to $40. Now, you've lost that entire $12k investment because the option is worthless. If you had bought the stock, however, you would have lost an additional $4k.\n\nAnd that's just looking at ATM call options in 2023. You could even do a $100 call which is going for $14.9k and in that case even if GME dropped to $120 the option would still have value. Alternatively, you could do an OTM call and risk less - a $300 call with 2023 expiry is going for about $10.7k.\n\nWhat strategy would be best depends on what your investment thesis on GME is, but with all the DD that's been happening on GME it seems most likely that in the next two years either GME will moon and go sky high, or will crash down and stay down. In either of those scenarios, the call option would've been the better bet.""",b't2_67fakjbw',2021-03-20 20:39:03+00:00
2485,"b""I was thinking monthlies rather than weeklies, but that's largely irrelevant. You're right in that it all depends on your thesis. \n\nLeaps, however, are nuts. Especially ITM leaps. \n\nYou're right that if it drops to 40 then you've lost 16k with shares and only 12k in leaps. If you go with your 100k for 14.9k and it drops to 120, then you've lost 12.9k instead of losing only 8k.\n\nBy owning shares you can write covered calls. Yes, you can write covered calls on a leap too, but man that sucks if you get exercised and have to give up all of that extrinsic value. So to avoid that you write calls that are further OTM, which means making less on your call writing. If you had 100 shares right now, you could be making bank writing way OTM covered calls. A 600 call right now gets you \\~$250 and at no point during this recent rise has the stock ended a week up 3x from the previous week so that's likely pretty safe. So if you were to buy 100 shares now, they're only costing 19750. Keep doing it and you'll drive that price down. \n\nAlso, shares can be in values other than 100. If you only have 12k to spend, then you can risk your leap and maybe 0 out or maybe make a lot. Or you can have 60 shares. \n\nBut again, ultimately it comes to your thesis. Mine is that GME has never in its life been worth more than 60/share and when this craziness is over it will drop to reality. Maybe in 3 - 5 years it'll be able to transition appropriately to a tech stock. But right now and for the short to mid-term future, it's a retail stock and retail stocks trade much lower than tech stocks.""",b't2_pix2480',2021-03-20 22:04:59+00:00

When I was looking at options when I bought in at $140, shares made a lot more sense and offered a lot higher return than holding options until expiration.\n\nAlso the market can offer really good bets on options (see my position in my post history) but you really need to know what the fuck you're doing.

4744,"b'Nah I would like to dispute this by saying TLT is highly shorted. I would like to point out that it started happening in September during the height of tech. The surge in long bonds would not cause a crash, rather it would likely cause a spike. I believe that hedge funds started shorting long bonds in order to cause tech to fall prior to the rebalancing that typically happens every December by passively managed funds. This year, they took greater advantage of that by selling the bonds prematurely and effectively causing tech to be sold off so the portfolio managers could manage a specific percentage of equal weighting.         \n\nIn short, hedge funds have been shorting tlt with short sales, using options to make it drop faster as it hits different tiers, and compounding the money they make with tech puts. They are preying on your parents\xe2\x80\x99 retirement funds. The only way to protect your parents is by forcing the lawmakers to ban short selling similar to how almost  every other nation in the world has banned short selling at some point in the past year(a lot of them still have it in effect).

4814,"b""It's not really laziness or embarrassment that is going to be the major driver for this shift in primary health care.  The entire healthcare model is very outdated.  Where we are now is where the music and movie industry was in the early 2000s, with services like Napster and Hulu fighting against RIAA and other industry behemoths that wanted to uphold their outdated model.  The people that are utilizing these new medical services are the early adopters, primary medicine will look a lot different in the future.\n\nSpecifically what's driving the changes:\n\n1. People have access to vast amount of information and are more educated regarding health than anytime in the past.  This allows drug and medical companies to market directly to consumers that understand what their products are for.  The old view of medicine is top down model, younger people are more desirous of a consultant model where the patient is the driver of the medical care, not the doctor.\n2. Diagnostic errors are common in primary care settings leading to delay in diagnosis and often resulting in the need for many followup appointments before correct treatment is initiated.  Many patients with unexplained issues eventually chose to bypass primary care (gatekeepers) due to frustration and seek specialist care in a self-directed manner.  For some issues even AI is more skilled at diagnosis than general physicians.\n3. Chronic disease management is generally performed by data collection and following guidelines and flowcharts.  The standardization of the management of these issues really paves the path for automation as data collection can be done many times at home or other convenient locations (like a 3rd party lab or imaging center).  There is less need for primary general physicians when processes are standardized for common chronic illnesses.  Preventative treatments and testing are also very standardized which could be automated without the need for the educational level of a physician.  We are already moving towards this by employing NP and physician assistants to manage primary care.\n4. Primary health care is unnecessarily expensive as compared to other professional services that people utilize and that have better systems for automating standardized tasks (for example, if I own a company, I can hire a payroll service that specializes only in that service at lower cost than a in house accountant performing the same function).\n5. Primary care is unnecessarily cumbersome as a process due to lack of automation.  Spending time scheduling appointments, going to appointments, having to wait sometimes weeks to even be able to get an appointment, figuring out post-service billing and insurance issues, having gatekeepers block access to services that the patient desires, etc. are all time consuming and could be fixed with different models.\n6. Outcomes are better without physicians for primary care.  \\*\\*\\*This is really the kicker.  In a lot of studies of  the NP model of primary care (with standardization and provider as consultant) shows that outcomes for patients are better for patients who's primary providers are NPs rather than a physicians.\n\nThe AMA has been fighting hard against the changes (ie restricting telemedicine, restricting automation, restricting what other types of providers can do under their licenses, etc).  The future might not look exactly like Hims&amp;Hers, but the fact is there that the top-down physician-as-authority model of primary medicine is not going to be the future either.""",b't2_ud3gy',2021-03-20 21:47:50+00:00

Sure these things will allow insurances to bill more at the cost to patients.\n\nTelemedicine can contribute to the health of a patient if they see someone and establish care with them first (I do a lot of telemedicine with my patients after I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them in person - I\xe2\x80\x99m capitated so they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay me extra).  But there are some issues that need to be dealt with in person.  But I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly talking about this from the angle of better healthcare and not the business side of it.  It could expand, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into these companies in terms of the business side much.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any positions in any of these telemedicine companies.  I have to turn away new patients because I have so many, unfortunately I can\xe2\x80\x99t take a lot of patients and people might have a hard time finding good providers and have to go on these platforms.\n\nNot investment advice, just personal anecdotal stories.'",b't2_utblv',2021-03-20 22:00:05+00:00

4861,"b""If you're short it's a turd. Nothing wrong with RKT, it's just easy to manipulate. I set up a small long term strangle at this level. I'll likely add every month. Most shorts in housing right now are betting on a market crash like 2008. But the problem with that idea isn't the data that supports it, it's the government that is supporting main street mortage holders. They will have to for years to come, but that will be better than a slow 12 year recovery like the last time.\n\nBut let's look at the positives that we know, first time homebuyers have been on the sidelines for years and are taking out loans now. Supply is short so builders are working like crazy now making up for demand. The supply side of the market is still projected to be 10 years out, not accounting for new generations. These all create fine jobs. \n\nRKT is going to be aggressive in changing the industry towards modern tech and timelines. Mac and Mae are still accounting for risk in the market and stopping risky investments on their portfolios from multiple property owners, one of the causes of the 2008 crash was investment property risk. Boomers will be downsizing their properties for the final stages of retirement. Projections say they are 40% of the market. \n\nWhile this catching up to the levels of 2008 was crazy fast, a year, no one is looking forward to a repeat. There is massive incentive to keep prices at this level. \n\nDownsides. Funding of property down payments with portfolios last year was alarming. \nInvestment properties in high cost cities got higher HuD funding, double edged sword, this might be speculative for micro bubbles as exodus from the cities from work from home companies is increasing. \nThe average price of a home increased at such a level that securing a down payment became out of reach for more and more people. Government has not kept track with this hidden inflation. As such lenders did not assume risk and passed it on to consumers by raising credit score limits. Tightening the noose on the pool of borrowers even further. This in turn canceled out the pool available for first time home buyer grants such as discussed by the $15,000 credit, or even the current $12,000 credit, or getting 2 mortages, 1 @20% for down, 1 for 80%. \n\nMortage rates rising. Neutral positon. The market needs to calm down in order for supply to catch up with demand. If boomers decide to dump 50% their properties and retire, great. Those houses will be snapped up at these rates. \n\nOur biggest problem with the market is simply the majority of houses are old, fucking 70's old on average. Flipping houses is great, but most people don't address anything other than cosmetic fixes. Supply needs to demo and rebuild modern housing in most markets. Like the 50's, 80's, and 00's did. This would offer some realistic benefit to the entire infrastructure, as electrical, energy savings, and mechanical systems could increase value while decreasing usage. The more modular a system, the better for cost. Imagine if HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac were part of the carbon offset buisness as well. And as a home owners you get a cut. \n\nOur second biggest problem is that wages have not kept up with productivity. If we were to see wages jump 10% and catch up with the 1990's, lol. Wages should always be tied to productivity. Accurate compensation is by far the biggest thing controlling supply and demand in the housing market. If the majority of wage earners could simply build a house with a few years of saving, the market would blow the fuck up. My family has never taken out loans, but has always owned land and houses, why? We build out of pocket. I haven't wanted to build another house for the housing market until this year. Global wages are just as bad.\n\nThird problem. Giant banks need to get out of mortages, and by all data points they seem to be. RKT, UWM, both of them have come to a point in their business that they need to keep the pressure on supply of mortages so demand increases. They need to work on positive government regulation for generation inclusion in the markets for years. They should call Disney\n\nFourth problem I don't know shit""",b't2_1zjtdcaz',2021-03-21 01:43:25+00:00

What do I mean by that? Those before the covid that were doing well were playing stock market. After the covid crash they're doing extremely well. All the lower working class not apart of the stock market just lost their jobs. That was it. This was a huge example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting worse.

You can go off opinion as Hindenburg used to justify most of their opinionated reported, or you can go off of facts and hope the dots contact to wealth.\n\nWhat are the facts?\n\n1) They have an agreement with Camping World for service station support and to BYOD them an RV. Marcus Lemonis isn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99d wager he\xe2\x80\x99s smarter than most of us. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s done his due diligence. More than anyone of us. Easy money follows smart money.\n\n2) The RV design will be used for an EV Van. Work truck and work van. Great accessible markets.\n\n3) Betas are in production now. All you have to do is wait for the proof by the end of this month. Take your chance and wait, or buy in now and enjoy the catalyst.\n\n4) They already secured a dealers license for the state of California. They will sell direct to consumer.\n\n5) They are using proven battery tech from LG Chem. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think LG Chem is a bunch of morons who put money into a sinking ship. A contract has to be made and money has to be guaranteed.\n\n6) GM is on the board of $RIDE. Yes, they struck out with Nikola, but everyone seems to have forgotten how fast they ditched Nikola when the report came out. GM hasn\xe2\x80\x99t budged. Easy money follows smart money.\n\n6B) GM is a partner and investor in $RIDE. They were since day 1 when they handed them a present for a factory. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget of the possible buyout once $RIDE gets all of its free money for government loans and grants.\n\n7) They have officially entered into a race. Why would $RIDE set themselves up for disaster on a public stage if they are unsure of their product? Or if one didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist?\n\n8) People keep complaining about a lack of product. Shut the fuck up. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pre revenue company, you dip shits. Product = revenue.\n\n9) The brilliant analyst at MS, Adam \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the fuck is a hub motor\xe2\x80\x9d Jonas thought the hub motors were part of the wheel assembly and thought each truck needed 5 motors. They don\xe2\x80\x99t. The hub motors are (gasp) part of the axle.\n\n9B) The Endurance can run on a single hub motor. Consider the equivalent of losing one cylinder in an ICE vehicle. Endurance &gt; ICE. Advantage for fleets.\n\n10) $RIDE has employees. 500 employees and 200 contractors. A fraud company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hire employees to twist on their on thumbs. Notice how \xe2\x80\x9cformer employees\xe2\x80\x9d were used in the Hindenburg report. Why not ask real employees? No names were given.

We're on track to have everyone eligible in May. \n\n2) Higher production plus J&amp;J makes Astra moot here. Like honestly, I could have cared less which one I got but I wouldn't have opted for Astra, not that it's been okayed here anyway. \n\n3) I'm basically a mini economic stimulus just waiting to blow money two weeks after I get my second dose. So is everyone I know. Where do I want to go? I don't care. Anywhere. Preferably anywhere warm. How will I get there? By being stuck in a small aluminum tube. \n\n4) Airlines are lucky. American is really lucky they got a bailout. I don't think there's a chance they would be around without one. Does that mean I like the stock? No, no I don't. But that's my bias coming in. Anyone ever gotten their flight canceled, then rebooked, then travel half way through their flight to then be told only half your flight was booked? Anyone ever been dumped at DFW due to the airlines fault and told your SOL? I'm not suggesting that can only happen with AA or that just because I've had dozens of bad experiences with AA that you can't have a good one. But I am suggesting that I think the airline is garbage. From their policies down to their customer service. In short, I'm a cheap ass. I'd fly on the wing if it was cheaper. But I'd pay more to fly any other airline, and that says a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm not buying AA. But I wouldn't bet against it because the rate of vaccinations here has gone from near zero to stadium fulls of people getting jabbed in the arm. And the minute it's safe to do so I'm flying. And although I will try my hardest not to fly AA, others won't care. \n\n  \nNecessary disclosures: I have shares in Azul. I don't give financial advice. I like eating crayons.
