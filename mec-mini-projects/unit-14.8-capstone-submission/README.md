# Unit 14.8 Capstone Submission

For this exercise we evaluated two models for sentiment analysis:

* FinBERT - An NLP model for financial sentiment analysis based on BERT. 
* XLNet - An NLP model based on BERT that features a generalized autoregressive (AR) pre-training method

Chapters 4.2 and 4.3 of the project doc details the training steps and results:
