I've good connections with the mainstream (The Daily Telegraph, The New-York Times etc.) and crypto media to push this project and secure an awareness about him + social media (SMM, SEO). As a professional Finance consultant and professor of Corporate Finance I've developed a business-model to secure that the project will break even.

I think the project needs a developer to create maybe on the already existing code the basic digital wallet. The new will be the voice identification of the user, the voice management of the digital wallet and the service of voice advertising. Possible investors and supporters of this socially important project are welcome, you can send me a direct message.

t3_mevewy,How to lose 80% of your portfolio in 1months...tips for beginners of what not to do..,btc,
t3_mevewy,"So i started crypto trading in feb when the dogecoin was getting hype so i said why the fu*k not so i took about 150$ from my savings ( i m 18 year old student and saved some money by giving tuitions to kids,, also thats quiet a amount in a third world country) and put 100$ @ 5.5 all into dogecoin it went up a little and i became happy with a 5% gain but decided to hold and after a day
 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1359519541219500033?s=19

 this tweet came out from elon about him buying doge for his son.. 

I panik buyed @7 like a stupid retard and buyed at pick price and just sat there thinking myself as a winner..but then everyone start selling and price went down to 5..now i thought that the hype is dead and just like what happened when elon first talked about doge and it pumped to 8.5 and fall to 3..i thought it will again fall to near 3 so i sold at loss    (buy high sell low lol) @5 and successfully turned my 150$ to 123$.. 


** never buy a coin while its pumping or just because someone is talking about it...this thing is called shilling where a person buy a coin at low price and then start to talk about it and promote the coin so prices go up and then they earn from your stupidity**


now i thought to myself i would never buy at peak so i looked around to find a coin which is at low price so i found CREAM.. at that time it was around 250$ and its all time high was 380$ so i thought 'yeah why not,its a discount right'..and invested all my money into it...but it kept falling and falling..i thought that i will not repeat what i did in doge and just hold but the price dropped to 180$ so me getting more and more upset i just sold it..now i dropped from 123$ to 88$..


**never buy a coin just because its low..and never buy a coin you dont know anything about..maybe you have heard this thing many times now but please do your own research..

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

As for me i will still try hard as i can to turn my 90$ to 250$ so i dont get scolded by my parents..",btc,

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from.

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),one,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t1_gsm0hrw,"&gt; I did not move anything at those prices. 

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token? What am I missing?",ada,

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),link,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

ALL VALUES IN €EUR

Last week's pick (well, a few days ago anyway):

SC @ 0.016
Current price: 0.02256
41% increase, certified genius.

Overall market trend for the week: Hold/Buy

Entry picks:

BAT - recent climbs to continue after consolidating and finding support in 0.8-0.85 range aiming to retest 1.00 within next few weeks. 

KSM - Risen meteorically in the last month from 175.00 to 410.00, barely even stopping to consolidate on the way, I expect this to continue.

NANO - I bought this at an awful time and eagerly anticipate a rise so i can break even and dump my bag. Seems to have finally found a floor at 3.6, hopefully can find some resurgence and tackle 5.00 again soon.

UNI - Recently consolidated and found support at 22.80, should break past 25.00 again and start retesting 30.00. Feels very underbought.

PRICE PREDICTIONS:
BAT - 1.02
KSM - 460.00
NANO - 4.50
UNI - 27.5

Exit picks:

Don't sell anything.

t3_mevewy,How to lose 80% of your portfolio in 1months...tips for beginners of what not to do..,long,
t3_mevewy,"So i started crypto trading in feb when the dogecoin was getting hype so i said why the fu*k not so i took about 150$ from my savings ( i m 18 year old student and saved some money by giving tuitions to kids,, also thats quiet a amount in a third world country) and put 100$ @ 5.5 all into dogecoin it went up a little and i became happy with a 5% gain but decided to hold and after a day
 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1359519541219500033?s=19

 this tweet came out from elon about him buying doge for his son.. 

I panik buyed @7 like a stupid retard and buyed at pick price and just sat there thinking myself as a winner..but then everyone start selling and price went down to 5..now i thought that the hype is dead and just like what happened when elon first talked about doge and it pumped to 8.5 and fall to 3..i thought it will again fall to near 3 so i sold at loss    (buy high sell low lol) @5 and successfully turned my 150$ to 123$.. 


** never buy a coin while its pumping or just because someone is talking about it...this thing is called shilling where a person buy a coin at low price and then start to talk about it and promote the coin so prices go up and then they earn from your stupidity**


now i thought to myself i would never buy at peak so i looked around to find a coin which is at low price so i found CREAM.. at that time it was around 250$ and its all time high was 380$ so i thought 'yeah why not,its a discount right'..and invested all my money into it...but it kept falling and falling..i thought that i will not repeat what i did in doge and just hold but the price dropped to 180$ so me getting more and more upset i just sold it..now i dropped from 123$ to 88$..


**never buy a coin just because its low..and never buy a coin you dont know anything about..maybe you have heard this thing many times now but please do your own research..

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

As for me i will still try hard as i can to turn my 90$ to 250$ so i dont get scolded by my parents..",long,

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),long,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

 this tweet came out from elon about him buying doge for his son.. 

I panik buyed @7 like a stupid retard and buyed at pick price and just sat there thinking myself as a winner..but then everyone start selling and price went down to 5..now i thought that the hype is dead and just like what happened when elon first talked about doge and it pumped to 8.5 and fall to 3..i thought it will again fall to near 3 so i sold at loss    (buy high sell low lol) @5 and successfully turned my 150$ to 123$.. 


** never buy a coin while its pumping or just because someone is talking about it...this thing is called shilling where a person buy a coin at low price and then start to talk about it and promote the coin so prices go up and then they earn from your stupidity**


now i thought to myself i would never buy at peak so i looked around to find a coin which is at low price so i found CREAM.. at that time it was around 250$ and its all time high was 380$ so i thought 'yeah why not,its a discount right'..and invested all my money into it...but it kept falling and falling..i thought that i will not repeat what i did in doge and just hold but the price dropped to 180$ so me getting more and more upset i just sold it..now i dropped from 123$ to 88$..


**never buy a coin just because its low..and never buy a coin you dont know anything about..maybe you have heard this thing many times now but please do your own research..

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

As for me i will still try hard as i can to turn my 90$ to 250$ so i dont get scolded by my parents..",dogecoin,

You can joke around and maybe even make money off it. Most people don't put their whole portfolio's in these but sometimes a meme coin can generate a year worth of hype in a single day which makes a lot of millionaires quickly but that's not the essence of this. The main goal or rather the reason people believe these ""shitcoins"" is they fell inlove with the community and want to see it succeed along with their investment. I certainly do.",doge,

Now i got really scared after consecutive loss so i started watching lots of youtube and by that i started to join there telegram channels where they give ""signals"" about what coin to buy and there targets...they claims that they do deep technical analysis and immediately inform the channel members on telegram..so i stared following there ""signals""..i use to just sit there with my binance and telegram open ,so that i can immediately buy it..and to my surprise it worked a few times..now i was up from 88$ to around 110$..but then the worst part happened...at the time i had joined around 5 channels...but 3 of the channels started announcing about a thing called ""mountain pump""..they said that they will pump a coin so much that the coin will 5-6x in few minutes..so as a fool i was i actually believed it...they started to gather hype from all social media they had and asked them to join there telegram channels so that you dont miss a ""once in a lifetime chance""..everyday they post about it and say things that will make you greedy like ""everyone will atleast double there money or they will make some celebrity tweet about the coin""..at this point i was so trapped into this that i deposited extra 100$ dollar just for this..so i was ready with my 210$ to ""double"" it..when the time actually came they  start to say things like you must hold for maximum benefit and after few minutes international fomo will hit and the coin will skyrocket..so they announced the coin ""MITH"" and i immiedietly bought it at market limit which was already at 64..you can check mith btc pair on 27 feb..yes i bought at peak again and now the coin started to go down so fast that i couldnt even react.i panic sold @48 and took the loss..


**never listen to anyone but facts..do your own fundamental and technical analysis before putting your hard earned money..for the minimum you can check for the use of coin or the partners it has..check there twitter if they actually are having any real world use..yes you can earn a lot from shitcoins which just operate because of demand and supply but it not the risk worth taking**


Now i m at 157$.. i decided to do some trading on the new nft craze..so i choose chz and actually earned quite a bit..i jumped to 190$..now i was feeling a little bit coinfidence..but maybe more than enough that i jumped in margin trading..i learned a little about it and choose CHR to risk it all...i was thinking that it will perform just like CHZ..so i yoloed the rest of my money and guess what happened...i got liquidated in just 8 hours..it was the time when btc dipped from 53k to 47k and pulled downed other altcoins with it..now i was at around 50$ and got so scared when i got the message of liquidation because i was actually out of town at that time and didnt checked the price for a long time...so yeah thats pretty much it about how i fu*ked up my savings..but just for update i actually learned a lot now and turned my 50$ to 90$ and still working on it..here are some tips i would like to give to beginners..(i learned the hard way)


*nothing is ever stable in crypto market


*dont believe in anyone even your fav. Crypto utubers.(but always learn how they trade..would suggest watch JRNY crypto)


* dont jump in any kind of liverage trading where you can borrow money from exchange if you have less than 6 months experience..it may seem very exciting but its really risky..


* start margin trading (if you are actually coinfident) with less margin(maybe limit it to 3x only)


*never buy when btc is pumping(mostly when btc pumps other coins also pumps)


*always diversify your portfolio.. Never yolo even though you are 100% coinfident..have atleast more than 4 coins..


*If you are new to crypto consider your experience time as a level that unlocks more coins as you progress..by that i mean for starting 2 months stay in top 10 crypto then in 3rd month start to deal with top 20..than after 6 months go for top 50..and on and on..because top coins are rather more stable and proven themselves more worthy than others.. definetly you wont gain massively but you wont loss too..


*join twitter and follow the most influential people and coin handles..because any announcement is done firstly on twitter..you can stay ahead of herd by doing this..


*try to talk to people and make friends crypto related even if they dont help you too much practically but after taking a huge hit..you would need someone to talk to..( i dont know if this works for others but i randomly found a guy whose city is close to mine and we really help each other in hard times)


* always keep some fiat currency ready if the market crash and always buy the dip but part by part.what i do is make 4 parts of my money and buy as the price goes down because you never know how much it will dip...


*and most importantly learn the power of holding...if i would have just hold any of the coins i have mentioned above..i would have already been up over 500$


(if you have any doubts i will try to solve it just dm me)
And i hope you guys earn a fortune :)

As for me i will still try hard as i can to turn my 90$ to 250$ so i dont get scolded by my parents..",chr,

t3_mfex7b,"For anyone buying BTC right now (price at 51130), I doubt BTC will even touch 55500 again before midnight(EST, so 2 1/2 hours). Not to worry though, it'll breakthrough and be supported at 56000, 60000, and definitely higher in the near future, but I see a lot of people thinking they're going to cause a bull rush by buying 0.005 BTC at the ask price. It does have an effect, but only in the sense it makes sellers set bolder limits. Then we're down again. It's like being at an amusements park. The fun part is on the way down. Be patient, and set bids instead of market orders. I think 54100 might be a good limit, but it's hard to tell. the past week I watched this happen about 5 times with BTC. A thousand mark gets crossed, it bounces momentarily, then it maybe happens one more time before the next time it gets crossed and shit hits the fan. There's just so many FOMO bag hodlers from the recent peak. They can only stand to see it cross certain lines.

t3_mf1ltz,32 Fundamental Reasons Why I Went ALL-IN on Smartlands (SLT),bull,
t3_mf1ltz,"Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary…right?).  

I’ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.  

At the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  

*Here are 32 reasons why:*  

***Tokenomics***  

1. **Supply** \- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  
2. **Market Cap** \- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  
3. **Staking Yield** \- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  
4. **Buy Pressure** \- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  
5. **Near-Zero Fees** \- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  
6. **Fast Transactions** \- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  

**7) Environmentally Friendly** \- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  

8) **Transparent** \- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  

9) **New Exchanges Coming** \- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen… and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  

10) **Bear Market Resistant** \- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  

***Platform***  

11) **Real Estate** \- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  

12) **SME Funding** \- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  

13) **Flexibility** \- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  

14) **Brand Name** \- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won’t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  

15) **Ukraine Launch** \- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world’s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning…  

16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia’s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  

17) **Built on Stellar** \- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  

18) **Marketing Hasn’t Even Started** \- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  

19) **First Mover Advantage** \- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success… but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  

***Partners***  

20) **Empire State Capital** \- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he’s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren’t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  

21) **Quantum Attorneys** \- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*

t1_gsm0hrw,"&gt; I did not move anything at those prices. 

Great, the whole point of the next upgrade to Ethereum (EIP 1559) is to make the gas fees regular and predictable so when that gets implemented you should be able to move your tokens without any risk of overpaying.


&gt; Bought more...lol Not Eth...Ada

Interesting, I'm looking forward to the Cardano blockchain getting smart contracts and therefore people starting to build a parallel DeFi ecosystem on it, assuming that ever happens, but I don't really understand where the value of Ada the token will come from. From what I've read the fees for transactions will be payable in whatever tokens you like, so why what will be the driving force behind buying Ada itself?

At the moment when I use DeFi applications I need to spend Eth, so even if my transaction is just moving some Dai to provide liquidity somewhere I need to keep buying and spending Eth to access Gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the plan with Cardano that I wanted to move my 'CarDai' tokens around I would just pay the fee using them? So what's the buy pressure going to be for the Ada token? What am I missing?",eth,
t1_gsl73w7,"It’s not anywhere near the level (technology wise) as Algorand, Cardano...Eth is constantly over promising and under delivering...it’s come a long way since the beginning, but quite soon the ecosystem will see a shift and divide as these protocols establish themselves...both are more efficient, secure, scalable than Eth...and what’s more, significantly less fees!!! Especially Algorand...Cardano has a built in atomic swap feature built in to the protocol.....no need for a Uni or SushiSwap....and I say this as a hodler of ETH,",eth,
t1_gsl7off,"Eth over promising and under delivering, yet Cardano doesn't even have working smart contracts",eth,
t1_gsm4cfa,"Coming April...as promised. I hold Eth, but they won’t have sharding anytime soon, gas fees will go down IF London fork actually happens In July, projects are already jumping ship. If it does happen in July, Cardano will have taken user anyway",eth,

t1_gsl6jgw,Way too expensive gas fees. Moving $500 from my wallet to an exchange would have cost me $82. Moving $200SNX would have cost $68. Left them there and swore off any eth or erc-20 tokens going forward.,eth,
t1_gslfcbl,"Current transfers are costing around 0.00279 ETH, it hasn't been over $5 for a simple transfer all day (https://ethereumprice.org/gas/). 

What wallet are you using and are you setting the transfer manually? If so you can check the current gas prices at https://ethgasstation.info/index.php to avoid overpaying (by apparently almost 20x... in your case!). Hope that helps a bit. 

Completely agree that gas prices are annoyingly high at the moment, they definitely add up when you're setting up complex DeFi transactions, but there's no need to spend that sort of gas just moving stuff around.",eth,

That’s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  

22) **Colliers International** \- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren’t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space…  

23) **Agroxy** \- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation… and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  

24) **Big U** \- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  

25) **Archax** \- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  

26) **Stellar Foundation** \- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world’s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  

27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  

***Community***  

28) **Level-Headed Investors** \- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  

29) **Real Accounts** \- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \*real people\*, using real accounts. There aren’t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  

30) **Community Website** \- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  

31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined… and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  

32) **Meme Magic** \- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!  

*Note: $320 is not a meme.*
