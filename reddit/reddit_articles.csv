If implied volatility is over 100-200%, there's very little money to be made with calls. Your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze? Well it won't fucking happen if you're paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.\n\nYou would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.\n\nIt pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions.

So please take what I say here with a grain of salt. Just know that just like yourselves, I\'m balls deep in the GME // AMC phenomenon, and the past two months have been the most interesting in all of my life.\n\nAlso, please note that I\'m on a laptop, so I\'ll likely come back and edit this to make it look more enjoyable on a phone.

A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. \n\nHe likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He\'s recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we\'ve been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they\'ve created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.\n\nAMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. \n\nBoth of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.\n\nAll we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it\'s quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.\n\nITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.\n\n**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**\n\nHere we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. \n\nAMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.\n\nEDIT: HERE ARE LINKS TO THE AQUISITIONS\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/89919?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;theme=1\n https://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/55225?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/28949?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/87923?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/82461?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;theme=1\n\nThese are just a few. There are more.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as I really believe that we\'re about to witness something that has never been seen before in the world of finance. \n\nRemember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:\n\n1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.\n\n2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don\'t you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) \n\n3. We\'ve determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they\'ve done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its\' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They\'re the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won\'t be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could\'ve been before, which will make for more tendies. :)\n\n4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We\'ll have to wait and see.\n\n5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. \n\n6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they\'re desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they\'ll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they\'re at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.\n\n7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we\'ve seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn\'t Stopped. \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n\n8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. \n\n\nWe\'re living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we\'ve made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we\'re up against.\n\nI\'m here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let\'s keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.\n\nTo the hedgefunds? I hope you\'re scared. I hope you\'re nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you\'ve so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you\'re fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. \n\nTo all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are. \n\n\n\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\n\nEDIT: \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\xa6\x8d\xf0\x9f\xa6\x8d\xf0\x9f\xa6\x8d\xf0\x9f\xa6\x8d\xf0\x9f\xa6\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8d\x8c\xf0\x9f\x8d\x8c\n\nEdit 2: Less retarded format\nEdit 3: FUND-A-LINGUS'",0.93,2311,0,2311

One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of recent conversations \\[on Reddit\\] including both GME and stimulus is low.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs some of you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.\n\nI\'ll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don\'t hesitate to ask questions below, and [here\'s a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the ""stimmy effect"" recently.\n\nTo start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:\n\n[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)\n\nHere is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus &amp; GME over time:\n\n[WSB comments discussing stimulus &amp; GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)\n\nThe drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I\'d disagree, I\'ll include that graph below as well:\n\n[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus &amp; GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)\n\nFrom both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here\'s a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.\n\n|**Day**|**Stimulus &amp; GME mention count**|\n|:-|:-|\n|3/15/21|124|\n|3/14/21|103|\n|3/16/21|74|\n|3/13/21|69|\n|1/14/21|67|\n\nTo take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.\n\n[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\\/ \\\\""stimmy ratio\\\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)\n\nI don\'t know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I\'d encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I\'ve been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.\n\nNote:  I don\xe2\x80\x99t have stake in $GME and don\xe2\x80\x99t actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis.

So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven\xe2\x80\x99t figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER.

This time with pretty shapes!'",t3_m9fq7w,t2_127zs3,2021-03-20 20:41:38+00:00,"b'Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  \xf0\x9f\x8c\x88\xf0\x9f\x90\xbb  thesis included.\n\nFirst, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441\n\nSecond, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:\n\n1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**\n2. **Cup:** The cup should be \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**\n3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to \xc2\xbd. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.\n4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup\'s advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.\n5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**\n6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle\'s resistance. **Maybe one day?**\n\nOkay now let\xe2\x80\x99s look at just the handle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea\n\nSo we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.\n\nLooking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.\n\nKnowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.\n\nThe only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.\n\nEvidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.\n\nPotential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19.

He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public.

24,wallstreetbets,b'UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now? Why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t panic sell. A value play and long term hold: Part 2',t3_m93mec,t2_kq1sa,2021-03-20 09:32:25+00:00,"b'So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. \n\nI previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and \xe2\x80\x9cshort squeeze\xe2\x80\x9d hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. \n\nBut the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. \n\nFirst of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change too much. \n\nThis is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:\n\n\n- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:\n\n4 buys, 1 hold.\n\nLow: 10.50\nAverage: 11.70\nHigh: 13.50\n\nThis represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings\n\n- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.\n\n- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he\xe2\x80\x99s that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. \n\n- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. \n\n- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. \n\n- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I\xe2\x80\x99m bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)\n\n- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. \n\n- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a \xe2\x80\x9cmoat.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how you grow a company. \n\nSome bear points:\n\n- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. \n\n- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I\xe2\x80\x99d say that if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the industry, you know that the housing market isn\xe2\x80\x99t cooling off any time soon. However, I won\xe2\x80\x99t claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.\n\n- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. \n\n- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I\xe2\x80\x99d say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. \n\n- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. \n\n\nLet me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.\n\nI am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. \n\nThis post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47.'",0.73,170,0,170

Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis\xe2\x80\xa6 I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.\n\nI am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like \xe2\x80\x9cIt might go down below 7.5,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCould it head to six or five?\xe2\x80\x9d Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company\xe2\x80\x99s market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was\xe2\x80\xa6 You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed\xe2\x80\x99s reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.\n\nA value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.\n\nThe 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).\n\nUWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management\xe2\x80\x99s estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.\n\nEmployees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.\n\nManagement is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nYes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket\xe2\x80\x99s massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.\n\nAt .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion\xe2\x80\xa6 This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.\n\nBut, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM\xe2\x80\x99s dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.\n\nNow, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put supply and demand in banana speak\xe2\x80\xa6 Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana\xe2\x80\x99s. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply\xe2\x80\xa6 Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!\n\nTo account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.\n\nI will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.\n\nSo, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:\n\n\xc2\xb7 Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity.

Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the \xe2\x80\x9cinventory is much less\xe2\x80\x9d than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that \xe2\x80\x9cCredit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.\xe2\x80\x9d She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of \xe2\x80\x9crestructuring,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caccess to credit,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cdown payment\xe2\x80\x9d as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.\n\n\xc2\xb7 Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.\n\n\xc2\xb7 I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.\n\n\xc2\xb7 Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC\xe2\x80\x99s and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.\n\nIf a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.\n\nThis has honestly been such a long write up I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.\n\nI do expect, despite this report I\xe2\x80\x99ve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I\xe2\x80\x99ll also tune in to Jim Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s interview with the CEO when it happens.\n\nThanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome References:\n\n[New home sales rise as buyers remain hamstrung by the lack of property listings - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-as-buyers-remain-hamstrung-by-the-lack-of-property-listings-11614180009)\n\n[26.4%: How builders are coping with low inventories - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/builders-are-selling-lots-of-houses-that-havent-been-built-yet-11614195857)\n\n[New home sales rise slightly, even as buyers see more affordability contraints - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-slightly-even-as-buyers-see-more-affordability-contraints-11611847410)\n\n[It\xe2\x80\x99s time buy these home builder stocks as part of the millennial-driven housing boom, analyst says - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-time-buy-these-home-builder-stocks-as-part-of-the-millennial-driven-housing-boom-analyst-says-11605881301)\n\n[Mortgage Rates Are Rising.

Current uses are for catalytic converters but as cars switch to EV, will be used for battery cells. Also used in jewelry.\n\nGOLD\n\nCurrent Price: **$1740/Ounce**\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 10 Billion or a cube 25m on each side.\n\nUses: TO FUCKING BALL OUT OF CONTROL\n\nPALLADIUM\n\nCurrent Price: **$2746/Ounce** (up 12% last month)\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 24 Million\n\nUses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry.\n\nRHODIUM\n\nCurrent Price: **$29,000/Ounce** (WTF! up 200% YTD)\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 70 million\n\nUses: Most commonly used as an alloy agent with other metals, Also used in jewelry, electric contacts and catalytic converters. Very hard substance. But apparently can be replaced with platinum (if you use more platinum).\n\nSILVER\n\nCurrent Price **$26.25/Ounce**\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 49 Billion mined but only 27 billion remain.\n\nAlmost half of the silver ever mined is now in a landfill. Also, it is not yet economically feasible to scavenge the landfills for salvageable silver based on the price (things aren\'t that blade runnery yet.)\n\nUses: The best conductor of electricity, used in all electronics and EVs. Silver is also used as an antibacterial agent. Also used as currency throughout history and as a fast way to move large amounts of wealth. The US Constitution explicitly mentions gold and silver as money.\n\nSo....\n\nWhy is the price of silver so low?\n\nIt occurs in the earth\'s crust at a ratio of 8 to 1 compared to gold yet it\'s only worth enough to feed a family of four at McDonalds? People have to literally dig this stuff out of the FUCKING GROUND.\n\n*Something doesn\'t add up.*\n\nThe current price ratio is 65 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold. Throughout history, the ratio has remained closer to 16 to 1 which at this gold price would imply a silver price of $112.\n\nThis sounds a little better.\n\nBank manipulation is well known in this space, and the paper market for silver only functions to suppress the price. If trading was conducted in a responsible manner the silver price would be much higher. Yesterday alone, 280 million ounces were bought and sold. This equates to 35% of the yearly mine production (800 million ounces). The big banks control the majority of the metals and have unlimited ammunition to short. This happens late at night, when there is no liquidity to push down the price. But the price has recently started to resist these dumps.\n\nBut the tides are turning, someone has been removing physical silver from the COMEX vaults and it is being drained at an alarming rate. This month, 26 million ounces of physical silver has been removed, which is almost four times the normal amount. It has been hypothesized that manufacturers are starting to source their metals from the COMEX directly. Additionally, the Perth Mint has been rumored to have run out of unallocated physical silver bars.\n\nIf there is even a tiny inkling of a bank run on silver, the price will shoot higher. And if you look at how undervalued silver is, both historically and when compared to other precious metals, the trade becomes a no brainer.\n\nThis is one of the last great trades.  They can\'t hold the ball under water forever.\n\nI would like to see this turn into a transfer of wealth from the blood sucking banks into the hands of us, the people. Silver will always be the people\'s money and this may be one of our only hopes to preserve our wealth for future generations.'",0.68,88,0,88

40,wallstreetbets,b'GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD',t3_m9i1at,t2_yujws,2021-03-20 22:38:35+00:00,"b""In the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. \n&amp;#x200b;  \n#GME Graph and Shorts  \nFirst, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  \n&amp;#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  \n&amp;#x200b;  \nNow, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    \n&amp;#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    \n&amp;#x200b;  \n#TSLA Graph  \nNow, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     \n&amp;#x200b;  \nTowards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  \n&amp;#x200b;  \nTesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     \n&amp;#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    \n&amp;#x200b;  \n#Is This Similar?\nBased on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   \n&amp;#x200b;  \nIt is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  \n&amp;#x200b;  \n#Unknowns\nNow, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   \n&amp;#x200b;  \nI would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  \n&amp;#x200b;  \nIf you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    \n&amp;#x200b;     \nFrom this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      \n&amp;#x200b;  \nThat's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;      \nNot financial advice.""",0.82,128,0,128

Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.\n\nA bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.\n\nA bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.\n\nSo reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.\n\nImagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.\n\nPV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523\n\nso if you wait a year you get more money for your car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?  Let's do the same PV(present value) calculation only considering inflation:\n\nPV + PV\\*Inflation = $10000 (FV) so PV = 9803.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso now considering both rates ( interest rate + inflation):\n\nPV +PV\\*interest + PV\\*inflation = FV -&gt; PV = FV / (1+ inflation+interest).\n\nSo going back to the car example and including inflation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPV = 100000 / (1 + .05+ .02) = $9345.\n\nSo, with inflation,  now the 9500 offer sounds better than 10000 next year.  The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.\n\nSo in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial.""",0.88,89,0,89

Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN\xe2\x80\x99T resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.\n\nI present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger\xe2\x80\x94bonds\xe2\x80\x94presents a significant downside risk.\n\n\\--\n\n**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**\n\nLast week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.\n\n**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**\n\nI can hear you retards whining about it now. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, these are your grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.\n\n**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**\n\nBack in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.\n\nCurrent P/E rates on the S&amp;P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.\n\n**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**\n\nMany crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, JPOW announced the FED won\xe2\x80\x99t let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.\n\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There\xe2\x80\x99s just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I\xe2\x80\x99m going here.\n\n**My play:**\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I\xe2\x80\x99m loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I\xe2\x80\x99ll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.\n\nPositions:\n\nQQQ 5/21 270P\n\nSPY 5/21 380P'",0.91,69,0,69

For prescription medicine, Hims &amp; Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims &amp; Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:\n\n\n* Skin Care\n* Hair Loss and Care\n* Sex products (ED, PE, Contraception)\n* Covid Tests \n* Supplements\n* Primary Care\n* Mental Care\n\n\n**Financials -** \n\n\n* Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt\n* Gross Margin of  77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)\n* 2.6B Market Cap\n* Negative (but improving) Cash Flow\n* Q4 EPS  of -.07 (Beat by .09)\n* Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth\n* 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)\n* Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM\n* $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate\n* Over 3 Million consultations \n* 91% Recurring Revenue\n\n\nSimply put, Hims &amp; Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, with the main problems being in the Cash Flow and Earnings per Share. However, both are improving significantly over time.\n\n**Growth -**\n\n\nHims &amp; Hers has many avenues to expand in, in every single part of their company. Because of how 91% of revenue is recurring, Hims &amp; Hers is free to take many risks in expanding, as revenue will not be negatively affected as long as the subscription models are sustained. \n\n\n[Potential Medical Product Growth](https://imgur.com/a/S3lWXmr)\n\nHims &amp; Hers\' Revenue numbers are also almost only Sexual Health and Hair/Skin Care for now, as their recent additions of Primary and Mental Care have not gotten adoption yet. In Q2 of 2020 92% of Revenue was from Skin and Hair Care, as mainly recurring revenue. Once adoption of Hims &amp; Hers Primary and Mental Care picks up, I can see the company\'s revenue increasing greatly, and the ecosystem created through Hims &amp; Hers\' other products will strengthen this growth.\n\n\n\n[2020 Q2 Revenue %](https://imgur.com/a/WtX16oq)\n\n\n\nThe structure of Hims &amp; Hers also a large reason Hims &amp; Hers has grown so much in only two years, and why the company can continue to grow. Almost every single part of the Hims &amp; Hers experience is proprietary and created in-house, as there were no outside options at the time. However, as these structure growths have already been completed, this means that these next few years are when they will be refined, increasing gross margins, cutting out unnecessary expenses, and allowing the company to escape the bloat of the American Healthcare system caused by individual medicine companies.  \n[Hims &amp; Hers structure](https://imgur.com/a/rjw0v0o)\n\n\n[Sources](https://investors.forhims.com/why-invest/default.aspx)\n\n\n\nAlthough Healthcare is already a Four Trillion Dollar industry, I believe that Hims &amp; Hers has an opportunity to grow the industry as well. Many people across America simply do not receive the healthcare they need, whether due to costs, waiting time, distance, or other reasons, and Hims &amp; Hers solves all of those problems. With appointments being online anyone across America and get diagnosed and receive a prescription within minutes, without needing to live near a hospital, and at a low cost.\n\n\n**Competitors + Why Hims &amp; Hers?**\n\n\nI would say that Hims &amp; Hers has a lot of overall competitors, but not for its niche and for many different reasons.\nThe biggest overall competitor would be $TDOC. As they are both in the Telehealth industry, they will inevitably clash, and of the two $TDOC is much larger. However, Hims &amp; Hers offers direct sales of a large variety of medicine and health care products, which $TDOC does not. Because of this, I believe Hims &amp; Hers will have a larger overall ecosystem in product offered, as well as capture the niche market requiring Skin Care, Hair Loss and Care, and Sex products, which $TDOC does not focus on. I also see Hims &amp; Hers as having a much larger favorability with younger generations, particularly millennials and under, due to a few reasons:\n\n\n* Branding- $HIMS is heavier on advertising, and their company image is more ""high status"" than $TDOC\n* More importance/education on Skin Care, Sex products, and Hair Loss and Care\n* Affordability - Hims &amp; Hers has primary care consultations for $39, which is a nice, consistent price especially when compared to the American healthcare system\n* Their Twitter account posts memes\n\n\nOther competitors: Those random Telehealth apps nobody knows about, Amazon (more pricing power on medicine), CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid (Lol)\n\n\n**Positions:**\n\n\n20 x $15c 4/16\n\n\n10 x $17.5c 5/21 \n\n\n(will be rolling out calls when they get closer to expiry into long term)'",0.79,46,0,46

We have all seen the amazing DD\'s floating around, talking about how amazing the company is. Now let\'s talk about some of the catalyst that will propel Rocket to a higher valuation and amazing company. (Spoiler: No short squeeze discussion here, there are other DD\'s floating around for that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral risk factors and plays affecting RKT price NOW:\n\n* General market was in a downward trend - FED meeting\n* Rates got spooked and ticked up\n* Raw Material Shortage\n* Lack of housing supply in prior months\n\nNow lets look at some of the catalysts that will work in RKT\'s favor in the coming months:\n\n* **Spring Housing Boom**. It is known that spring and pre-summer are the most active in real-estate, and this year is no different. We should expect an uptick in movement/sales/refi/building.\n* **Biden Administration $15k first time home buyer tax credit &amp; DACA eligibility**. This administration is kicking housing into full gear the next couple of months by offering MAJOR incentives for first time homebuyers. They are also making the 700k DACA recipients elidable for federally insured mortgages (guess where younger folks shop for stuff? Online)\n* **Housing data comes out this week**. The outlook looks positive so far (I will go over this thesis in a bit) with the release of housing data, we will get a peer into the real estate market and trend. Overall, the market is still very hot, with huge demand spikes. This will only carry over into the spring housing market boom, and will incentivize more owners to capitalize on this selling opportunity and for builders to kick things into high gear. Overall the trends look good, and in favor of RKT.\n* **The new inventory spike**. With homes selling quick, and bidding wars happening, supply will soon catch up to this demand and we should see an up-tick in home sales. Last month, severe winter storms temporarily disrupted some of the supple of homes nationally. As we move into March, we should see more movement.\n* **Interest rate uncertainty**. This is a double edge sword. If we think of the inverse, with homeowners knowing that rate increases are imminent, it will incentivize more refi\'s before. On the flip, what happens when rates go up? RKT adjusts their financials as well. There are many articles analyzing the affect of higher rates, and overall, it seems to have little impact on the short term demands in the coming months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let\'s try and break apart the data we have access too, to try and predict how the housing data will look next week. Let\'s start with the MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTITAL CONSTUCTION, FEBURARY 2021:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zf5ev4mds9o61.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e053936be22dc7c1344af79f7757358f612ad7\n\nWhat we can gather from this, is Feb had a down-trend in Permits/Starts/Completions. Let\'s dig deeper into some of the numbers from the report. When we do, we can see that the New Privately-Owner Housing Units Authorized (Basically new builds coming up), was higher this last month by +28.9% YoY and +3.9% MoM. Ape speak? More supply is on the way!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/388skcdht9o61.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b75bdffc2aebe76caceacc7fb36f40bc6b41bee\n\nThe report goes into more detail, I encourage everyone to take a deeper look. *The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.* The outlook on supply catching up to demand is in the numbers, we should see more sales happening over the next couple of months, and see a positive upward trend.\n\nAlso a good report to look into is the [Weekly Economic and Housing Market update.](https://www.realtor.com/research/video-weekly-economic-and-housing-market-update-mar-19-2021/) They talk about most of the points referenced here, but one snippet stood out:\n\n&gt;""Despite higher rates, our latest Weekly Housing Trends View shows that prices are rising and homes are still selling faster.

Read more inside.'",t3_m9drpf,t2_n0cy3,2021-03-20 19:04:37+00:00,"b""So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.  \n\n\nThe majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.  \n\n\nOf course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.   \n\n\nWelcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.  \n\n\nHere comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.  \n\n\nThe stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.  \n\n\nThis is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.""",0.62,39,0,39

Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.',t3_m9i5q6,t2_3epiw2e7,2021-03-20 22:44:52+00:00,"b""Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.\n \nPoshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. \n\nThe company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry. (As it expands to Australia, it is trying to enter the pets market and distribute pet supplies and accessories like Chewy)\n\nAs POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.\n\nPOSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company\xe2\x80\x99s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.\n\nRevenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.\n\nConsumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. Sellers are starting to prefer the site as they do not have to deal with estimating shipping price. There is only USPS priority. This allows the item to reach the buyer much faster and saves the time of the seller. Items over $500 are sent to Poshmark to ship to the buyer. This is to verify authenticity. This reduces/eliminates any scams that sellers or buyers have to go through for fake item claims. Trust is essential. Convenience is key. \n\nPoshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.\n\nCowen &amp; Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.\n\nTL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Well let me learn you some additional market mechanics.\n\nSay you own 100 shares of $GME at $100 and you can sell a $110 call covered call for $10.\n\nGiven that price, what's the cheapest a $100 put could be to buy? Well, it better be $10 or greater because otherwise there would be an arbitrage!\n\nSay the put cost only $9, then you could pay for the put with the $10 call, and guarantee yourself $1 per share.\n\nSo what does this mean? As call option prices are driven up by MMs, put option prices must rise similarly, and this introduces another opportunity to influence the price of the stock ***by selling puts and collecting a fat premium.***\n\nSay you sell a put. What does the MM need to do to hedge their risk? **They need to buy stock because they are now long a put to offset the negative delta in the put.** What happens as the price moves upwards? MMs will sell that stock at a slow rate since gamma will drop off slowly. What happens if the price moves downwards? MMs will need to buy the stock an accelerating pace since gamma will increase rapidly on the put.\n\n**This strategy will essentially put a floor on the price on the price of GME and you get to collect the premiums being induced by the MMs on the call side.**\n\nIt's also a way to lock in a buy at a lower if getting assigned on an option is your thing.\n\nDownsides: you're short convexity on this trade, so don't expect your account to double or triple. Then again, the MMs are trying to prevent run up, so convexity is unreasonably expensive to begin with. Additionally, it's very capital intensive (unless you hedge with long puts instead of cash security).\n\nAside: Put call parity is actually a far more complicated mechanic with American options due to early exercise, but the point still stands that puts must increase in price along with calls if MMs try to discourage gamma squeezing.\n\nImportant Edit: Take a look at puts prices sub $100. Even a $50 put out a few months has stupidly high premiums to eat up.""",0.66,25,0,25

She\'s going to give me a proper bollocking if this goes tits up.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugzs426t58o61.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e75f1b777dcb0e559e525301b0200ddd7a76983b\n\n**BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO:**\n\nThey sell tobacco. They sell cigs (Newport, Camel). They sell vapes (Vuse, Glo, Velo) . They sell snuff (Grizz). The business model is extremely simple and has been a cash cow in the traditional tobacco market. Still beaten down as investors shift away from cancer in a stick and move to 50x price / sales companies. As investors start to worry about inflation and shifting to value, you\'re looking at value stock #1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FUNDAMENTALS:**\n\nNot going to spend a ton of time here as everyone knows tobacco stocks are cheap and i know all you lads don\'t really care about them. (also these are multiples from Friday 3/12).\n\nEV / FWD EBITDA: 8.4\n\nPrice / Forward Cash Flow: 6.8\n\nPrice / Book: 1.0\n\nDividend Yield: 8.0%\n\n$BTI is legitimately is 10 - 20x cheaper than all these tech darlings which is understandable, but maintaining this business model is simple. CAPEX is minimal and they maintain complete pricing power. Okay, well all this is obvious, so why should $BTI move up? Enter Altria (**$MO**).\n\n**THESIS:**\n\n* **My main thesis is that the move up in tobacco has already started.** $MO is showing strength for the first time in years. Go search for $MO on twitter and you\'ll find a bunch of **stick-men (technical analysis)** analysis like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rmw9ttxd8o61.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d50d47e6c81b34313f26742a97777d914d2721e0\n\nI have a piece of the $MO run-up  (not to brag), but am shifting those tendies to the better value, $BTI. I still like $MO a lot and think that the confluence of stick-men, your divvy crew, and overall lack of ""cheap"" stocks are contributing to the run up of tobacco. Now that the runway is clear, other tobacco stocks should follow ($IMBBY,  $PM are comparable if you\'re looking for other industry plays).\n\n(Side note: the $MO play is straight out of the Michael Burry playbook, and may his soul rest easy after selling both $GME And $MO early. I bet his soul is resting easier after his $C calls are most likely waaaay in the money. if you are a frequent visitor, Michael, please feel free in joining me in $BTI so that you may relieve the pain of selling $MO too early).\n\nBack to your regular programming. When you stack the performance of $MO vs. $BTI when the pandemic started, you get:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ab0o4l8e78o61.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1041280bb39f87b988c05ec5a91a6359e1b144e\n\n$BTI clearly lagging after trading in tandem for a few months. This divergence has dramatically increased over the past month. Now you may say that $MO deserves to trade higher and that it must be related to performance, right? Nawww, **$BTI has outperformed $MO on a per share fundamental basis the past few years, yet still trades cheaper.** The pure strength of their combustable market is incredible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bv9m37e0e8o61.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78dc47910d38d8c6d9ecdf827adbb8534730038a\n\nSeems like these should could trade closer in price, no? I have a theory or two in the risk/other section, so go check that out. Anyway, I think **\\*both\\*** trade higher and lift each other. Tying this all together: **My thesis is that I\'m expecting $BTI to follow the $MO move and break out of its choppy zone. You\'ll then start to see the divvy crew and stickmen start to post about how they\'re adding for income or that they ""trade the chart and not the stock"".** I\'ll feel rekt about this if $MO reverses, so if you\'ve gotten to this point and hate the idea, the opposite side of this whole thesis is to buy puts on a $MO reversal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OTHER TAILWINDS:**\n\n* **Fears of inflation?** **(Skip this bullet if you don\'t like economics)** You\'re looking at one of the most demand inelastic products on the market. People have bought tobacco and will continue to buy tobacco for years to come. There is no better place to look at this moat than with Australia (where a pack of cigs is 5x more expensive compared to the U.S.). In the past 10 years tobacco prices have doubled, yet demand has decreased by 20-ish percent. They have complete pricing power, or an economists wet dream. I\'m not here to FUD you to death about how inflation is going to wreck the economy, but price increases are already here. Go look at any relevant commodity/house price/vapor ware chart and you\'ll see inflation baked in. $BTI has complete pricing power.\n\n[Prevalence of Regular Smokers in Australia 18+](https://preview.redd.it/6x1z6x6ta8o61.png?width=2092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fc0d9ef09192b44995d2424adc492cba359a81)\n\n[Time needed in minutes to buy 20 cigarettes](https://preview.redd.it/ic1w1ce7b8o61.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b4fca9b6f0e90dc60c0ba75d904a4b9b387b090)\n\n* **Growth exists for vapes**, and seem a bit undervalued after the JUUL disaster a few year ago. BTI is looking to triple their vape segment to $5B by 2025. If this was a pure tech company you could throw on a 50B market cap by that volume/percent growth alone (i know this is not comparable, but I will still keep harping on it)\n\n[Investor Day Slide](https://preview.redd.it/s7ix4hjrg8o61.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ef936c704e70e093ebac06b8edc8d610c714f87)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ride the cannabis wave.** $BTI recently bought 20% of Canadian cannabis/CBD company Organigram $OGI. Would have loved to see this in 2018/2019 during the true downturn in weeeed, but these acquisitions are positive imo. A low key benefit to acquisitions in the space is that they can strike out a few times without crippling the business. Must be nice to have billions of dollars of free cash flow with small relative CAPEX [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products)\n* **They are literally making a covid/flu vaccine and the irony here is next level.** You can\'t think of a better way to ~~create more nicotine addicted customers than injecting it straight into their veins~~ change the narrative about tobacco as an ESG plant. I guess there is a real precedent here as they\'ve successfully used this tech for ebola. Anyway, not sure how this plays out in the long-term, but it seems like a net plus. Currently in phase I trials, I imagine successful results headline could give the price a bump. No idea when they\'ll announce results, but phase I trials started in December. [https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK\\_\\_9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE TRADE:**\n\n* **Calls are cheap.** Like 20% IV cheap. $MO moved 20% over the past one to two-ish months and a similar move in $BTI could result in massive gainz, depending on the strike/date. The price on these bad boys are simply too cheap. I currently have been easing into calls with dates and strikes: **4/16 40, 6/18 40 and 45.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RISKS/OTHER:**\n\nI will tell you though, that even though i may lie on the spectrum, I\'m not blind. So that you don\'t obliterate me into being completely biased, I have a few reasons why **$MO** has outperformed and other general comments:\n\n* Respective Index performance: The **U.S. indices have massively outperforming the U.K market** and their stock prices are moving more in line with the index.\n* **$MO has investments in beer/liquor from Anheuser Busch.** Some armchair analysts think they should sell that position as they are eligible to sell later this year. \n* **Both have shitty balance sheets** packed with oodles of goodwill from all their acquisitions over the years. $BTI has a worse debt load (Reynolds acquisition) compared to $MO so their capital allocation is less flexible (also why they earn more?). This has allowed $MO to start investing in share buybacks.\n* **You\'re buying cancer in a stick**. I\'m completely aware that large institutions and many individuals won\'t even look at tobacco as it\'s the polar opposite to any ESG play. **My mega brain** tells me that this is contradictory to many investing in any ESG plays that actually guzzle oil to operate, literally any fast food/sugar company, or most tech stocks that are melting/stealing (privacy crew, wya?) our brains. **My galaxy brain** tells me that investing in humans is the most non-ESG idea possible, so let\'s countertrade humans by investing in products that kill humans (was that too dark? definitely went a little dark there).\n* There is **beef (lawsuits) between $BTI, $PM and $MO**. $BTI is currently suing the two for patent infringement on some of their vapes. I\'m not even going to pretend like this is good or bad news for the company given the length of these timelines and unpredictability of outcomes. There is an $HCMC suit that also files against $PM, but any predicted outcome feels like pure speculation. Someone smarter than me can tell you why this case is positive/negative\n* **EX-DIV is next week** at $0.75 per share. The price will trade down post recording. This is always a chicken or the egg argument, so I won\'t bias you in either direction. Bulls will tell you that the stock price will trade up before as investors buy in before to get the dividend, while bears will tell you owners will dump after the dividend is recorded. No opinion here, but something to be aware of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary, TL;DR:**\n\n**You\'re buying a company that offers a highly addictive product with complete pricing power and free cash flow to the moon. The industry outperforms in inflationary or recessionary environments. Investments in alternative products (vapes, CBD, vaccines) are all niceties and should help the business grow, while the cash cow of tobacco remains king.**\n\n**Their main competitor, $MO  (sitting on a 52-week high) has cleared the runway for $BTI to make a similar move as the stick-men and income investors look for yield in an increasingly expensive market. The implied volatility on these calls are cheap (IV at 20).**\n\n**BS pRiCe TaRgEtS: 1 $MO ($50.55) = 1 $BTI (Currently, $39.27). I\'ll let the stickmen tell you where it can actually pop to, but I believe these are fundamentally the same company on a per share basis.**\n\n**Positions:**\n\nHigher Risk: **4/16 40C, 6/18 45C**\n\nLower Risk: **6/18 40C**\n\n**Cheers lads. Decent that, but I\'m knackered and going to have a few bevvy\'s to wind down.**'",0.69,23,0,23

You\'re almost guaranteed to profit by betting against me and as such, neither is financial advise. The following is my observations.\n\nGenerally speaking I genuinely believe that immunity and the progress of vaccination  is oversold and that the broader market is hyped on fugazi. The facts remain:\n\nThe projected immunity of the US population (stated that 70-90% being fully vaccinated) is around Oct-Nov^(1).\n\nThe US awaits the Trial of AstraZeneca before FDA approval (I\'ll return to why I estimate this approval won\'t change much).\n\n""Only"" 12.x% of the US is currently 2-dose vaccinated.\n\nAAL is nearing in on the stock price around $30 prior to Covid-19 restrictions and the market fall in March 2020 - and that\'s even with their own projections of Q1 capacity being down 45%^(2).\n\nThe projection^(1) estimates \\~50% being 2-dose vaccinated during the summer months (June-August).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why FDA approval of AstraZeneca won\'t change the projections imo**\n\nCVST is the short answer. I know fuck-shit about medice or the likes however, I do follow the vaccine status of the EU where I\'m residing and the increased number of reports of Blood Clots in the brain (the ones being smooth on you) post AstraZeneca Jabs (*I\'m not myself saying they are directly linked, others are indicating this though*). As of writing there has been:\n\n* 2 Deaths in Denmark\n* 1 Death in Norway\n* 1 Death in Spain\n* 1 Death in Austria\n\nThat *may* have been linked to the injection of AstraZeneca. The EMA had a conclusion on their hearing the 18th that stated ""The benefint (READ: Herd immunity) outweighs the risk""^(3). Norwegian researches came to the conclusion that it was linked to the Astra vaccine^(4). \n\nAnd in the context of the US we\'ll need to look at **risk factors** for CVST, where one in adults is Obesity^(5). According to CDC above 40% was Obese through 2017-2018^(6) (too lazy to find newer numbers).\n\nAll the above nonsense is fine, what matters is **public perception**. Choose between Pfizer/Moderna or a Vaccine that in the media is portrayed as only \\~60% effective^(7) and has resulted in blood clots. *I know which one I\'d prefer.*\n\nOh yeah, Ursula von der Leyen threatens to halt export of Astra jabs until the EU has had their promised deliveries, which are delayed and pose a risk to the EU herd immunity progress. (*Tinfoil-hat on* which may be why the EMA and WHO really needs to calm the tits down of the general public surrounding the vaccine? *Tinfoil-hat off*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, back to AAL**\n\nHow will this affect AAL leading into the summer you ask. Less travel. Less travel than anticipated at least.  \n\nBut, what about easing the travel restrictions? \n\nWell, there may be *domestically*, idk about internal US policy but from my point of view, jamming many people together in a metal tube for hours while still not immune in the herd might be just about as dumb as buying these puts. \n\nInternationally, I highly doubt we\'ll see travel unless the vaccination pasport is introduced, which projection wise only half of the US population would be able to supply at that time. Iceland already did this.\n\nWe\'re seeing more and more evidence for a third wave in Europe with Paris going in lockdown^(8).\n\nOh, right, the negative impact 2020 had and Covid overall on flying, cruises and the likes is also underplayed imo. I think we\'ll see some time go by before we\'re back to anything remotely close to pre-covid, if we ever get there..\n\nAnother observation is that the reported passengers while increasing in to double and nearly tripple from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 respectively, there isn\'t much upside to be seen in the Qx reportings that yield -2.07B, -2.4B and -2.18B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Confirmation Bias**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if\\_youve\\_never\\_bought\\_puts\\_heres\\_a\\_free\\_one/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if_youve_never_bought_puts_heres_a_free_one/)\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal\\_huge\\_debt\\_relief\\_and\\_why\\_it\\_is\\_time\\_to\\_sell/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal_huge_debt_relief_and_why_it_is_time_to_sell/)\n\nI\'ve excluded all the posts that goes against but you can do a quick search yourself: [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I looking at buying**\n\nPUTS. Puts around a strike price of $24 since I\'m too scared to go hardcore short via CFDs (which we Europoors can). I also need to keep up my trackrecord of shorting via Puts which is 100% loss \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e\n\nI\'ll be attempting to gather Put options with strike $24, Expiry  20th of August and hopefully a premium of 2.0-3.0 which seems about adequate for my pessimistic perception of the aviation sector going into Q2-Q3 2021.\n\nIm poor af so may only be able to get 2 contracts at this premium. We\'ll see. I\'ll update when (if i get the premium i want) the options.\n\n \n\nAs always, *not financial advise.*\n\n\\---\n\n**References**\n\n^(1) [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html) &amp; [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html) states that it\'s safer to use the vaccinated than previously affected to get herd immunity.\n\n^(2) [https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)\n\n^(3) [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots)\n\n^(4) [https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510](https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510)\n\n^(5) [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis)\n\n^(6) [https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)\n\n^(7) [https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know)\n\n^(8) [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html)'",0.56,9,0,9

The stock is still \\~50% off Jan 2020 highs, IMO putting it solidly in undervalued territory.\n\n**The Turn**\n\n&lt;political statements deleted&gt;, one analysis is that things might not be as bad as they seem in the Florida of South America (shoutout to @[CallsOnAlcoholism](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallsOnAlcoholism/)) and even if they are, they have until September to figure it out. Other bullish signals:\n\n\\- The Brazilian Central Bank made use of a recently passed autonomy law (limiting exec/legislative interference) by increasing its benchmark interest rate to 2.75% \\[larger than expected 75 bp increase compared to 50 bp expected\\] and they signalled a repeat at their next meeting in May. Rising interest rates are generally good for bank stocks as they increase revenue/margins. Whether they are similarly good for emerging economy bank stocks, I guess I will find out.\n\n\\- The three analysts I could find that follow this stock returned an average price target of %7.50 (just confirmation bias, analysts are mostly tea-leaf readers).\n\n\\- Minimal short interest 25M shares (0.6% of float).\n\n**The Prestige**\n\nBrazil has a funny trend of shitting the bed when you expect it to pay off, and paying off when you expect it to shit the bed. My analysis is that the negative catalysts have been priced in, blood is in the streets, and the probability of positive catalysts appearing before September is greater than 0.5. Shares are likely a better play than options, substantial return potential and lower risk.\n\nObviously the best play is to avoid entirely (see previous 100% loss), Brazil is a crazy place. \n\nO demonio s\xc3\xb3 tenta quem que esta mais perto de deus.""",0.57,5,0,5
